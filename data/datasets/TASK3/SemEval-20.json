[["Next plague outbreak in Madagascar could be 'stronger': WHO\nGeneva - The World Health Organisation chief on Wednesday said a deadly plague epidemic appeared to have been brought under control in Madagascar, but warned the next outbreak would likely be stronger.\n\"The next transmission could be more pronounced or stronger,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva, insisting that \"the issue is serious.\"\nAn outbreak of both bubonic plague, which is spread by infected rats via flea bites, and pneumonic plague, spread person to person, has killed more than 200 people in the Indian Ocean island nation since August.\nMadagascar has suffered bubonic plague outbreaks almost every year since 1980, often caused by rats fleeing forest fires.\nThe disease tends to make a comeback each hot rainy season, from September to April.\nOn average, between 300 and 600 infections are recorded every year among a population approaching 25 million people, according to a UN estimate.\nBut Tedros voiced alarm that \"plague in Madagascar behaved in a very, very different way this year.\"\nCases sprang up far earlier than usual and, instead of being confined to the countryside, the disease infiltrated towns.\nThe authorities recorded more than 2 000 cases, and Tedros said Wednesday the death toll stood at 207.\nHe also pointed to the presence of the pneumonic version, which spreads more easily and is more virulent, in the latest outbreak.\nHe praised the rapid response from WHO and Madagascar authorities that helped bring the outbreak under control, but warned that the danger was not over.\nThe larger-than-usual outbreak had helped spread the bacteria that causes the plague more widely.\nThis along with poor sanitation and vector control on Madagascar meant that \"when (the plague) comes again it starts from more stock, and the magnitude in the next transmission could be higher than the one that we saw,\" Tedros said.\n\"That means that Madagascar could be affected more, and not only that, it could even spill over into neighbouring countries and beyond,\" he warned.\nComplicating vector control is the fact that the fleas that carry the Yersinia pestis bacteria that causes the plague have proven to be widely resistant to chemicals and insecticides.\n\"That's a dangerous combination,\" Tedros said.\n", ["Repetition",

American Freedom Defense Initiative, best known for a pro-Israel \"Defeat Jihad\" poster campaign on the New York subway.\nOn both of their blogs the pair called their bans from entering the UK \"a striking blow against freedom\" and said the \"the nation that gave the world the Magna Carta is dead\".\nThey were due to attend a march planned by the far-right EDL to mark Armed Forces Day on 29 June, ending in Woolwich, south east London, where soldier Drummer Rigby was murdered last month.\nKeith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, who had called for the bloggers to be banned from the UK, said: \"I welcome the home secretary's ban on Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer from entering the country.\nThis is the right decision.\nThe UK should never become a stage for

\"inter-community violence\" in the UK.\nBoth letters gave examples of anti-Muslim views stated by both and went on to say that should they be allowed to enter the UK the home secretary believes they would \"continue to espouse such views\".\n", ["Black-and-White_Fallacy", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling,Labeling", "Flag-Waving", "Slogans"]], ["Kate Steinle's death at the hands of a Mexican national became a flashpoint in the immigration debate \u2014 here's the story behind her killing\nThe surprise acquittal of Jose Ines Garcia Zarate in the shooting death of San Francisco woman Kate Steinle set off a firestorm of outrage Thursday night, as top conservatives and critics of so-called \"sanctuary cities\" pinned blame for Steinle's death on illegal immigration and insufficiently aggressive deportation policies.\nGarcia Zarate, a 45-year-old Mexican national who was homeless and living in the US illegally when he fired the shot that killed Steinle, was acquitted by a jury on murder and manslaughter charges.\nThe jury convicted him of the lesser charge of being a felon in possession of a gun, which carries a maximum sentence of three years in state prison.\nSteinle, 32, was fatally shot while she walked along Pier 14 of the San Francisco Bay with her father in July 2015.\nThe bullet that pierced her back had ricocheted off the concrete ground after it was fired by Garcia Zarate from a handgun belonging to a federal ranger that had been stolen four days earlier.\nGarcia Zarate's defense attorneys argued that the shooting was an accident \u2014 they said he found the gun wrapped in a T-shirt or cloth under a pier bench and unintentionally discharged it.\nLead attorney Matt Gonzalez has argued that the weapon was a SIG Sauer with a \"hair trigger in single-action mode\" \u2014 a model well-known for accidental discharges even among experienced shooters.\nGonzalez told the jury, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, that Garcia Zarate had never handled a firearm before, was frightened by the noise of the gunshot, then flung the weapon into the bay where it was later found by a diver.\nProsecutors, however, alleged that Garcia Zarate brought the weapon to the pier deliberately to do harm, and intentionally aimed and shot Steinle after firmly pulling the trigger.\nThey said Garcia Zarate then threw the weapon into the bay and fled the scene.\nBeyond the shooting itself, perhaps the most controversial aspect of Garcia Zarate's case involves his previous criminal activity and history of deportations, and how San Francisco and federal authorities handled his custody before he ever picked up the gun and shot Steinle.\nAt the time of Steinle's death, Garcia Zarate had been convicted of nonviolent drug crimes and deported five times since the early 1990s.\nHe faced a sixth deportation in 2015, and was in Justice Department (DOJ) custody that March after serving 46 months in prison for a felony re-entry into the US, but instead of transferring him into the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for deportation, the department transferred him to the San Francisco County Jail for prosecution of a 1995 marijuana charge.\nSan Francisco prosecutors, who had long ago deprioritized marijuana charges, dismissed the decades-old charge and released Garcia Zarate on April 15, 2015.\nDue to San Francisco's policy of limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities \u2014 which some refer to as a \"sanctuary\" policy \u2014 the city did not inform ICE when they released Garcia Zarate.\nAs a result of the case, both the DOJ and the city of San Francisco have changed several policies.\nThe DOJ announced in 2016 it would no longer release potentially deportable detainees to local jails without first allowing ICE to take custody.\nSan Francisco, meanwhile, has adjusted its policy to notify ICE if they are releasing suspected undocumented immigrants who face charges of serious or violent felonies.\n\"This tragedy could have been prevented if San Francisco had simply turned the alien over to ICE as we requested, instead of releasing him back onto the streets,\" ICE Director Thomas Homan said in a statement on Thursday.\n\"It is unconscionable that politicians across this country continue to endanger the lives of Americans with sanctuary policies while ignoring the harm inflicted on their constituents.\"\nBut ICE has faced criticism of its own over not seeking a judicial warrant to legally obtain custody of Garcia Zarate when it discovered he had been transferred into San Francisco's custody.\nThe agency has argued that obtaining judicial warrants are unnecessary and would place too much burden on ICE officials and federal courts.\nThough the agency did issue a request to the city to detain Garcia Zarate until ICE officials could pick him up, their detainer requests are not signed by a judge and are therefore not legally binding.\nSan Francisco's policy is to ignore such requests if they are not accompanied by judge-signed warrants, and the city has cited federal court cases concluding that such detentions violate inmates' Fourth Amendment rights.\nGarcia Zarate's deportation and criminal history made him an effective target for immigration hardliners, who argued that Steinle would still be alive were it not for an insecure border and lenient treatment toward suspected undocumented immigrants in local jails.\nPresident Donald Trump immediately seized on the verdict on Thursday as evidence of the perils of \"Illegal Immigration.\"\nTrump frequently villainized Garcia Zarate and cited Steinle's death during his presidential campaign, using the case to bolster his argument for a border wall and aid his crusade against \"sanctuary cities.\"\nEarly on Friday, Trump also falsely claimed on Twitter that Garcia Zarate had previously committed violent crimes and had illegally entered the US six times due to lax border security under the Obama administration.\n\"The Kate Steinle killer came back and back over the weakly protected Obama border, always committing crimes and being violent, and yet this info was not used in court.\nHis exoneration is a complete travesty of justice.\nBUILD THE WALL!\"\nTrump tweeted.\nIn fact, Garcia Zarate had never been convicted of a violent crime before Steinle's shooting \u2014 his previous convictions were for nonviolent drug crimes and illegal entry.\nLax border security, too, does not appear to be a factor since Garcia Zarate was caught by border patrol agents each time he entered the country under the Obama administration.\nIn contrast, Steinle's family has expressed nuanced views on immigration and \"sanctuary\" policies.\nThey have both condemned Trump for \"sensationalizing\" Steinle's death to advance anti-immigration policies, and expressed frustration with San Francisco officials, who they believe went too far in refusing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.\n", ["Loaded_Language", "Whataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring", "Causal_Oversimplification", "Name_Calling,Labeling", "Slogans"]], ["U.S. judge frees Indonesian immigrant held

Bush administration, was going to delay confirmation even more.\nSenate Republicans dealt with that problem by deciding to not bother with any Kavanaugh documents that couldn\u2019t be produced rapidly, which further riled up the Democrats and gave that party some good talking points.\n2\nSometimes it\u2019s worth taking risks.\nPresidents who shy away from anything that\u2019s not a sure thing can fail to exploit opportunities.\nIt\u2019s just very hard to see any upside for Trump in choosing Kavanaugh instead of a safer, but still very conservative, other option.\n3\nWhen serious charges of sexual misconduct were raised against Kavanaugh, Trump decided to stick with him instead of moving on to another candidate.\nIt\u2019s still not clear that Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination is doomed, but it\u2019s certainly in severe trouble.\nLosing a high-profile fight is always going to hurt a president, which is why they should take care to avoid high-risk, low-reward conflicts.\nBut there\u2019s an art to minimizing damage.\nAnd Trump hasn\u2019t learned it yet.\nFor one thing, the president has made this an extremely high-profile episode by stringing out the process as the accusations against Kavanaugh gained credibility and even multiplied.\nWhether that matters in terms of public opinion for Trump is unclear, but it certainly isn\u2019t good for any Republican senators caught up in the middle, along with any other candidates who have had to weigh in only to find the facts as they knew them constantly changing.\nIt\u2019s also the case that the more negative information comes out, the more it appears that the Trump and his White House staff failed to do their jobs in vetting and managing Kavanaugh.\nIf the nomination had been pulled right after Christine Blasey Ford made her initial assertions about Kavanaugh, the public might have concluded that it wasn\u2019t Trump\u2019s fault that a previously unaired accusation came to light.\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s behavior has been as erratic as ever.\nFirst he said that Brasey had to be heard; then he attacked her in terms that were a slur on all women who have been assaulted without immediately reporting it to the police, and he also blamed the Senate for not voting before she came forward.\nHe sometimes praises Kavanaugh, but also let it be known that he thought the nominee had performed badly in his Fox News interview.\nThe White House demanded a final up and down vote on Tuesday; by Wednesday, he was saying that the nomination would die if Kavanaugh didn\u2019t do well before the Judiciary Committee on Thursday.\nThe sum of all this has been, as in many other episodes, that Trump and his White House are a gang that can\u2019t shoot straight and that he\u2019s eager to blame his allies and lash out at his enemies in ugly ways when things go wrong.\nA botched nomination matters because allies will be less likely to trust Trump, not just on Supreme Court choices, but on any initiative.\nAnd, for that matter, they\u2019ll be less likely to trust him when he asserts that there\u2019s nothing remaining for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to reveal.\nTrump\u2019s professional reputation is already terrible, but everything counts.\nAs the political scientist Richard Neustadt said, political elites are constantly evaluating and re-evaluating the president.\nTrump is hurting himself right now, and will have hurt himself more if Kavanaugh is not confirmed.\nAnd yes, I call it the cut-of-his-jib test quite deliberately.\nIt's no surprise that someone who hires based on what he thinks someone doing that job should look like, which seems to be based on hazy old-time Hollywood casting, would wind up with fewer women in his administration than any of his recent predecessors.\nI've argued that too much disclosure is required, and that Democrats (and any wavering Republicans) had more than enough information to make up their mind.\nI still think that's true.\nBut it did leave Republicans vulnerable to claims about transparency which were likely to be popular -- most people, and the entire press corps, love transparency -- and vulnerable to bombshells in the documentary record which hadn't been initially disclosed.\nIn the event, that's not what's causing the trouble, but still it's an example of Trump taking needless risks.\nSome have speculated that Kavanaugh would be especially likely to rule in Trump's favor if any cases stemming from the Robert Mueller investigation wind up at the high court.\nPerhaps.\nThere are plenty of other partisan, conservative judges, and plenty of conservative judges who lean towards an expansive view of presidential powers.\nAnd if Kavanaugh is really an outlier on that issue, then he won't be in the majority on any future decision anyway.\nSo, no, I don't think there's any good reason to think Kavanaugh would be especially helpful to Trump compared to others he could have selected.\n", ["Doubt", "Exaggeration,Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Causal_Oversimplification", "Name_Calling,Labeling", "Appeal_to_Authority"]], ["Domestic abuse allegations against Keith Ellison cannot be substantiated, Dems' lawyer says\nA lawyer hired by Minnesota Democrats says she is unable to substantiate the accusations of domestic abuse against Rep.

Bernie Sanders and Tom Perez, chairman of the DNC, who urged to investigate the claims and Kavanaugh.\nMonahan went to reiterate that her story has nothing to do with politics.\n\u201cI have nothing to prove to anyone, I simply shared my story.\nPeople can believe it or not.\nI don\u2019t need anyone to affirm my humanity, I affirmed it,\u201d she wrote in another tweet.\n\u201cThe fact that both parties only care if it scores political points is hypocritical,\u201d she added.\n\u201cDo you think a person who has dealt with any form of abuse by politicians is thinking about politics?\nNo, we & are families are trying to heal.\u201d\n", ["Loaded_Language"]], ["Agencies scramble to prep Russia probe files for release after sweeping Trump order\nIntelligence agencies were scrambling Tuesday to comply with a sweeping order by President Trump to declassify key documents that could shed light on the origins of the Russia collusion probe that has hamstrung the administration for more than 18 months.\nThe documents Trump ordered declassified involve a renewed Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant against former campaign aide Carter Page and text messages from disgraced former FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.\nThe president on Monday afternoon ordered that the documents be released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Justice Department \u201c[a]t the request of a number of committees of Congress, and for reasons of transparency,\u201d according to a statement issued by White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.\nIt is not immediately clear how and when the documents will be released, but by Monday evening, intelligence agencies said they had already begun working to prepare the documents.\n\u201cWhen the President issues such an order, it triggers a declassification review process that is conducted by various agencies within the intelligence community, in conjunction with the White House Counsel, to seek to ensure the safety of America\u2019s national security interests,\u201d a Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News.\n\u201cThe Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are already working with the Director of National Intelligence to comply with the President\u2019s order.\u201d\nODNI spokeswoman Kellie Wade also said that the agency was \u201cworking expeditiously with our interagency partners to conduct a declassification review of the documents the President has identified for declassification.\u201d\nThe documents include all FBI reports on interviews, also known as 302s, with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with applications to surveil Carter Page, as well as 21 pages of one renewed warrant.\nThe 21 pages make up only a small portion of the 412 pages of FISA applications and warrants related to Page released by the FBI earlier this year in a heavily redacted format.\nThe June 2017 application was the last of four filed by the Justice Department in support of FISA court orders allowing the monitoring of Page for nearly a year.\nThe president also ordered the release of unredacted text messages from fired FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok, former FBI counsel Lisa Page, former FBI Director James Comey and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.\nThe president for months has blasted Strzok and Page for the bias revealed in their text messages, as well as Comey and McCabe for their leadership of the FBI.\nComey was fired from the bureau in May 2017; McCabe was fired by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in March; Page left the bureau in May; and Strzok was fired last month.\nA source familiar with the timing of the declassification told Fox News they expected the Carter Page warrant application to be declassified first, followed by the FBI reports on agent interviews with Ohr.\nThe source added that the Justice Department is working on a \"compressed timeline\" and they expect the first release of records in days or sooner.\nThe text messages are expected to take longer because of the sheer number involved and the fact that Trump ordered their release without redactions.\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill, including House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., are touting the president\u2019s order, saying it covers \u201cpretty much everything that he wanted\u2026and the text messages are a bonus,\u201d a source said of Nunes.\nCongressional Republicans are hoping the files reveal details about the start of the Russia investigation led by the FBI, which evolved into Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election.\nBut Democrats,including the committee\u2019s ranking member, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., are blasting the declassification order as a \u201cclear abuse of power.\u201d\n\"[Trump] has decided to intervene in a pending law enforcement investigation by ordering the selective release of materials he believes are helpful to his defense team and thinks will advance a false narrative,\" Schiff said.\n\"With respect to some of these materials, I have been previously informed by the FBI and Justice Department that they would consider their release a red line that must not be crossed as they may compromise sources and methods.\n\"This is evidently of no consequence to a President who cares about nothing about the country and everything about his narrow self-interest,\" Schiff added.\nThe president\u2019s order is similar to his February move, when he cleared the way for the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee to release a partisan memo about the surveillance warrant on Carter Page.\nDemocrats, weeks later, released their own version of the memo.\n",

unprecedented and surreal talks between US President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un culminated on Tuesday with fulsome declarations of a new friendship but just vague pledges of nuclear disarmament.\nFor Trump, that amounted to a triumphant outcome in his extraordinary gamble with the rogue kingdom's despotic leader.\nBut there were scant details on what new commitments had been secured from Kim, even as Trump announced he would end the regular military exercises the US conducts with South Korea.\nWhether nuclear disarmament is indeed the final outcome of Tuesday's summit won't be known for years, if not decades.\nBut the dramatic act of extending his hand to one of America's longtime adversaries will forever illustrate Trump's gut-driven, norm-shattering tenure.\n\"We both want to do something.\nWe both are going to do something.\nAnd we have developed a very special bond,\" Trump said at the conclusion of the landmark summit.\n\"People are going to be very impressed.\nPeople are going to be very happy.\"\nThe document he and Kim signed said the North Korean leader \"reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\"\nIn exchange, Trump agreed to \"provide security guarantees\" to North Korea.\nBut there was no mentioning the previous US aim of \"complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization.\"\nAnd Kim's commitments did not appear to go beyond what he already pledged to do in April when he met South Korean President Moon Jae-in along their countries' border.\nTrump insisted during a news conference the agreement went further than many people expected.\nBut he acknowledged the effort to rid North Korea of its nuclear arsenal was in its early stages.\n\"We will do it as fast as it can mechanically and physically be done,\" he said.\nMore critical, in Trump's telling, was the development of a personal bond with Kim, a brutal dictator responsible for the deaths not only of his own citizens but of at least one American, Otto Warmbier, who was returned to the US in a coma only to die days later.\n\"I think our whole relationship with North Korea and the Korean Peninsula is going to be a very much different situation than it has in the past,\" Trump said during the summit.\nLater, during his news conference, Trump said Warmbier's death contributed to the summit taking place.\n\"Without Otto, this would not have happened,\" Trump said.\nTrump and Kim -- both intent on making history -- greeted each other early in the day with extended hands in front of a row of US and North Korean flags, a previously unthinkable sight that reflects a new chapter in the two countries' acrimonious relationship.\nTrump's threats to politely walk out of the meeting if his expectations were unmet did not materialize.\nInstead he predicted he could \"solve a big problem, a big dilemma\" alongside his new partner.\n\"Working together, we'll get it taken care of,\" Trump said.\nThe remarks came amid an improbable series of events that few could have anticipated even three months ago.\nThe unlikely images of US and North Korean counterparts engaging in friendly dialogue lent the day an air of unreality.\nIn a detailed menu, the White House said the men were served H\u00e4agen-Dazs vanilla ice cream for dessert.\nOther unforeseen events also surrounded the summit, increasing the drama.\nMinutes before the historic handshake, Trump tweeted that his top economic adviser Larry Kudlow had suffered a heart attack.\nImmediately after the encounter, Dennis Rodman -- one of the only Americans to have met Kim -- was openly weeping while being interviewed by CNN's Chris Cuomo.\nEven Kim seemed to acknowledge the surreality of the day.\n\"Many people in the world will think of this as a (inaudible) form of fantasy ... from a science fiction movie,\" his translator was overheard saying as the two leaders walked down a white-columned colonnade.\nAt the conclusion of the summit, Trump hailed the talks as a historic, and personal, achievement.\n\"We learned a lot about each other and our countries,\" Trump said.\n\"I learned he's a very talented man.\"\nWhen pressed about those comments in light of Kim's brutal tactics, Trump continued praising the North Korean leaders' ability to run a country at a young age.\n\"He is very talented,\" Trump said, citing Kim's ability to \"take over a situation like he did at 26 years of age and run it, and run it tough.\"\nKim assumed power after his father Kim Jong Il, also a brutal dictator, died in 2011.\nThroughout the day, Trump and Kim's body language was openly friendly, a striking warmth given Kim's iron grip on power and dismal record on human rights.\nTrump's move to meet him attracted fierce criticism for normalizing a regime routinely called out for its human rights abuses, that over years has built an image of fearsome renegade regime, throwing around threats of nuclear war.\nThe day began with Trump patting Kim on the back and placing his hand on the North Korean's shoulder as they walked into their first meeting.\nLater they were seen smiling and laughing over lunch.\nTrump told reporters he would \"absolutely\" extend an invitation to the White House to Kim, who also heralded a new era.\n\"Today, we had a historic meeting and decided to leave the past behind,\" Kim said through a translator.\n\"The world will see a major change.\"\nThe meeting came only months after the two men traded nuclear taunts, ratcheting up tensions and leading to fears of war.\nBy contrast, Trump appeared to back off a military footing on Tuesday, declaring the US will stop the \"war games,\" an apparent reference to joint military exercises with South Korea that North Korea has long rebuked as provocative.\nTrump also said he hopes to eventually withdraw US forces from South Korea, but said \"that's not part of the equation right now.\"\n\"I want to get our soldiers out.\nI want to bring our soldiers back home,\" Trump said.\n\"But that's not part of the equation right now.\nI hope it will be eventually.\"\nTuesday's meeting, convened at a luxury hotel on the island of Sentosa, came just three months after Trump accepted North Korea's invitation for talks on the spot.\nIt was an extraordinarily compressed timeline for the landmark summit, which at one point was called off entirely as communication broke down between Washington and Pyongyang.\nThe talks were quickly revived, leading to the highly choreographed event that unfolded Tuesday.\nAfter the men shook hands, they repaired inside for one-on-one talks.\nIn that first meeting they were joined only by translators, a break from standard practice of having at least one aide present for high-stakes huddles.\nLater in the day, advisers joined the talks for a larger bilateral session and a working lunch.\nTrump took keen interest in the pageantry of the day, insisting the pictures beamed around the world reflect a commanding leader making a decisive, world-altering move.\nAt the same time, he'd admitted he didn't believe he required extensive preparation to take stock of Kim.\nAs part of the advance work, Trump commissioned a highly produced video meant to convince Kim to relinquish his weapons and open his country to outside investment.\nTrump showed Kim the movie on an iPad during their talks.\nHere in futuristic Singapore, however, Kim was able to view the benefits of economic advancement at close range.\nHe was spotted taking a moonlit stroll around the high-end Marina Bay Sands hotel and casino, owned by GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson, the type of glitzy development few North Koreans could ever imagine coming to their country.\nKim was cheered by onlookers who caught sight of the dictator, who until earlier this spring was not believed to have ever left North Korea as supreme leader.\n", ["Repetition", "Black-and-White_Fallacy", "Exaggeration,Minimisation",

class.\nBut the 7-year-old is also a huge fan of the weekly Bible course at Princeton Primary, his public elementary school.\nHe gets to play matching games about Bible stories and listen to classic tales.\nNoah and the Ark is a favorite.\nAdam and Eve and the garden of Eden, of course.\nAnd the story about how their son Cain killed his brother, Abel.\n\u201cThat one was a little bit of a surprise,\u201d Trenton said as he sat with his parents, Brett and Courtney Tolliver, one day this month watching his little sister\u2019s soccer practice on a lush field in this small town in the mountains of southern West Virginia.\nThis spring, Bible classes such as Trenton\u2019s are on the minds of many here in Mercer County.\nFor decades, the county\u2019s public schools have offered a weekly Bible class during the school day \u2014 30 minutes at the elementary level and 45 minutes in middle school.\nBible classes on school time are a rarity in public education, but here they are a long-standing tradition.\nThe program is not mandatory, but almost every child in the district attends.\nAnd there is widespread support for the classes: Parents and community members help raise nearly $500,000 a year to pay for the Bible in the Schools program.\nNow Bible in the Schools is facing a stiff legal challenge.\nTwo county residents with school-age children argue in a lawsuit that the program violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment and the West Virginia constitution.\nFiled in January and amended last month by the Freedom From Religion Foundation, the suit charges that the Bible class \u201cadvances and endorses one religion, improperly entangles public schools in religious affairs, and violates the personal consciences of nonreligious and non-Christian parents and students.\u201d\nSupporters are adamant that the weekly class is an elective meant to explore the history and literature of the Bible, not to promote religious belief.\n\u201cMy experience with it has been very positive.\nI\u2019ve never known of anyone who has been pressured or felt ostracized,\u201d said the Rev.\nDavid W. Dockery, senior pastor at First Baptist Church of Princeton.\n\u201cAny time God\u2019s word can be proclaimed is beneficial and is a good thing.\u201d\nTrenton\u2019s parents also find it hard to see why there would be objections.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a great program mainly because it\u2019s the only chance for some of these kids to even see the Bible,\u201d said Brett Tolliver, 27.\n\u201cMore importantly, I don\u2019t know who it harms.\nThe kids aren\u2019t forced to be there.\u201d\nCourtney Tolliver, 26, a teacher in the district, agrees.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not teaching religion, but it teaches character and respect and how important it is to tell the truth,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe kids love it and the ones who don\u2019t participate aren\u2019t made to feel left out.\u201d\nBut the plaintiffs in the suit and their backers argue that the program\u2019s popularity shouldn\u2019t matter in the face of Supreme Court rulings such as McCollum v. Board of Education in 1948 that have banned public schools from initiating or sponsoring religious activity.\nThe suit alleges that the lessons in the Mercer schools are similar to what a child would hear in Sunday school and that they advocate the Ten Commandments and treat stories in the Bible as historical fact.\nThe suit quotes from one lesson: \u201cIf all of the Israelites had chosen to follow the Ten Commandments, think of how safe and happy they would have been.\u201d Another lesson asks students to imagine that humans and dinosaurs existed at the same time.\nIt says: \u201cSo picture Adam being able to crawl up on the back of a dinosaur!\nHe and Eve could have their own personal water slide!\nWouldn\u2019t that be so wild!\u201d\nThe district declined a request to observe one of the classes.\nElizabeth Deal, who describes herself as agnostic, is one of the plaintiffs in the case.\nHer daughter attended elementary school in nearby Bluefield, but Deal kept her out of the Bible class.\nEven though the class was optional, Deal said there weren\u2019t any alternative lessons or activities for those who opted out.\nHer daughter was told to sit in the computer lab for that half-hour and read a book.\nBypassing the class left her vulnerable to bullying.\nDeal said other students told her daughter that she was going to hell.\nOne day a student saw her daughter reading a \u201cHarry Potter\u201d novel and told her, according to the mother: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be reading this.\nYou need to be reading the Bible.\u201d\nEventually Deal moved her daughter to a public school a few miles away in Virginia where there is no Bible class.\nShe pays an out-of-state fee of several hundred dollars, but she no longer worries about her child being taunted.\nDeal said she joined the suit because she believes strongly in the separation of church and state.\n\u201cWhen something is wrong,\u201d she said, \u201cyou have to stand up against it.\u201d\nGod is a big deal in Mercer County, home to about 125 churches that dominate the main streets of its biggest towns, Princeton (population 6,400) and Bluefield (10,400), and smaller burgs such as Athens (1,000), Bramwell (360) and Oakvale (120).\nA lot of the good jobs in the county have left \u2014 22 percent of its 61,000 residents live below the poverty level \u2014 but the churches have stayed.\nYou can find the Church of God here.\nAnd the Church of Christ.\nAnd the Church of Jesus.\nThere are a couple of Catholic churches, a synagogue and a mosque, but the vast majority of houses of worship are Baptist, Methodist or Pentecostal.\nThe radio in the region is filled with gospel stations, Bible talk shows and Christian rock.\nBillboards tout the Ten Commandments or offer stern messages on abortion and eternal salvation.\nBeneath a Chick-fil-A billboard in Princeton, another asks: \u201cIf you die tonight.\nHeaven or Hell?\u201d\nThe Rev.\nRay Hurt has been the lead pastor at the Church of God in Princeton for more than two decades.\nThe church, one of the largest buildings in town, can hold up to 2,000 people for Sunday services and often does.\nFor Hurt, Bible in the Schools, which has been in the public schools here in one form or another since 1939, is simply a way for students to further their knowledge.\n\u201cThere is a great deal of not just poetry and prose in the Bible, but from what I\u2019ve read almost every piece of history that\u2019s in the Bible has eventually been proven,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe see the Bible not just as a book of faith but as a pretty accurate account of history that informs us about a lot of things that happened.\u201d\nHurt, whose son, the Rev.\nJ.B. Hurt, is also a minister in the Church of God and a member of the county school board, says he would oppose the program if he thought it was being used to teach religion or if students were required to take the class.\nBut he also embraces the idea that the Bible offers irrefutable lessons in morality and teaches the difference between right and wrong.\n\u201cIf you read the Bible, you\u2019re going to get a whole lot of good ideas that are going to stick with you and make you a better person,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to push religion with it.\nIt speaks for itself in terms of morals and ethics and those things.\u201d\nThe idea that a weekly Bible class for 6,600 students in 16 public elementary schools and three middle schools is somehow simply an academic offering doesn\u2019t sit well with Lynne White, 54, a former two-term school board member and mother of two sons who went through Mercer schools.\n\u201cAs a person of faith myself, I don\u2019t see any problem with having an after-school Bible program,\u201d White said.\n\u201cBut to me this seems a pretty clear violation of the Constitution.\u201d\nWhite holds the school board and leadership responsible for spreading what she says is a false sense of what the Bible in the Schools program is and does.\nIn a commentary for the Charleston Gazette-Mail, White wrote that \u201cthe Bible in the schools program in Mercer County is being sustained on a foundation of lies.\u201d\nShe argued that the classes are character education based on biblical values, that they were not electives because West Virginia doesn\u2019t offer electives in elementary or middle school and that even though the classes are funded by private donations, that doesn\u2019t mean they should be taught during the instructional day.\nShe also said it was untrue that children who didn\u2019t take the class weren\u2019t made to \u201cfeel different or ostracized.\u201d\nWhen White posted the article on Facebook, she heard from some supporters, but many others questioned her faith.\n\u201cI will pray for you and all non-believers Lynne White.\nGod Bless!\n!\u201d one wrote.\nAnother wrote:\n\u201cLynne White You are not a Christian, a Christian is a person who strives to be more Christ like with everything they do and I do not believe Christ would be working to shut this program down or alter it to include your worldly views.\u201d\nIf it were simply a popularity contest, Bible in the Schools would be allowed to continue as is.\nEven the president of the local mosque in Princeton says it should stay.\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to be God-fearing no matter how you approach it,\u201d said Mohammad Iqbal, head of the Islamic Society of the Appalachian Region.\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s the Bible, whether it\u2019s Koran, whether it\u2019s Torah, whether it\u2019s some other book.\nBut it should be optional, not enforced.\nIf the parents have no objection and the student has no objection, it is okay.\u201d\nBut the program\u2019s fate will not be resolved by popular vote or on Facebook posts.\nInstead, the question will be tried in the courtroom of Judge David A. Faber of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia in Bluefield.\n(Faber was nominated by President George H.W.\nBush.)\nRepresenting the Mercer school district is the First Liberty Institute, a nonprofit law firm based in Texas that specializes in religious freedom cases.\nHiram Sasser, a lawyer at the firm, said the district\u2019s main objective is to allow the Bible course to remain as an elective while making sure it complies with the law.\nThe district filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on Wednesday.\n\u201cThere are two things to look at,\u201d Sasser said.\n\u201cThe first is whether you can have a Bible course at all.\nAnd the other is whether you can have the Bible course as it is presently constituted.\nIt\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019re very confident on the first issue.\nAnd on the second issue .\n.\n.\nour client is very, very flexible in terms of making sure that the content is in compliance with the law.\u201d\nBut the plaintiffs aren\u2019t looking for flexibility.\nThey want the Bible class out of the school day.\nThe program \u201cis unconstitutional at its core and cannot be saved via modifications,\u201d said Patrick Elliott, a lawyer with the Freedom From Religion Foundation.\n\u201cThere is no legally permissible way for Mercer County Schools to continue with any type of program like this.\u201d\nAccording to Elliott, the Mercer program is \u201cextremely rare\u201d and there are only a handful of districts around the country with similar courses.\nThe amended complaint, Elliott said, seeks to prevent the school system from \u201corganizing, administering, or otherwise endorsing Bible classes for Mercer County Schools\u2019 students in grades kindergarten through eighth grade.\u201d\nCharles C. Haynes, the founding director of the Religious Freedom Center at the Newseum in Washington, doesn\u2019t foresee the program surviving a court challenge in its current form.\n\u201cThis is a loser for the school district,\u201d Haynes said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to satisfy the First Amendment in elementary school when it comes to the Bible.\nStudents at that age really aren\u2019t prepared to tell the difference between what is history and what is religious conviction.\u201d\nHaynes argues that people of faith are doing their religion a disservice when they try to have it taught by a government entity.\nThey would rightly object, he said, if they lived somewhere where they were the religious minority and supporters of another religion wanted a course on their faith taught in public schools.\n\u201cEven if 99.9 percent of the people in the community want it, they need to remember that liberty of conscience is not up for a vote,\u201d he said.\nTrenton Tolliver is oblivious to the Bible battle that swirls around him.\nHis first-grade school year ends next month.\nHanging in the balance of the court case is what he will learn in the Bible course in second grade.\nOr if there will be a Bible course at all.\n", ["Appeal_to_fear-prejudice", "Black-and-White_Fallacy", "Loaded_Language", "Whataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring", "Name_Calling,Labeling", "Slogans"]], ["CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta Has Press Pass Restored by White House\nJim Acosta has his press pass back.\nThe Trump administration stood down on Monday from its nearly two-week-long dispute with CNN over the White House credentials of Mr. Acosta, informing the correspondent that his badge was formally restored.\nCNN in turn dropped its lawsuit on the matter, which had ballooned into a test of press freedoms in the Trump era.\nBut while it yielded to Mr. Acosta \u2014 whose testy questions had touched off Mr. Trump\u2019s ire \u2014 the administration used the occasion to lay down a set of formal rules governing reporters\u2019 behavior at future White House news conferences, a highly unusual step.\nAmong the guidelines was a restriction of one question per reporter, with follow-ups allowed at the discretion of the president or the White House official at the lectern.\n\u201cFailure to abide,\u201d the administration warned, \u201cmay result in suspension or revocation of the journalist\u2019s hard pass.\u201d\nThe White House sought to blame Mr. Acosta for behaving disrespectfully, although Mr. Trump often lobs insults at journalists and encourages a free-for-all format when taking questions from reporters.\nCodifying the behavior of journalists struck some as an ominous encroachment into freedom of the press, and the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association said on Monday that it had not been consulted about the new guidelines.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, in a statement, said: \u201cThese rules give the White House far too much discretion to avoid real scrutiny.\nThe White House belongs to the public, not the president, and the job of the press is to ask hard questions, not to be polite company.\u201d\nStill, the guidelines are not far removed from the manner in which White House news conferences typically proceed.\nMr. Trump made clear last week that he would introduce \u201cregulations\u201d after a federal judge criticized the White House for stripping Mr. Acosta\u2019s credentials without due process or a coherent rationale.\n\u201cWe would have greatly preferred to continue hosting White House press conferences in reliance on a set of understood professional norms, and we believe the overwhelming majority of journalists covering the White House share that preference,\u201d Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, said in a statement.\nPress relations were not always rosy in pre-Trump days.\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s aides preselected the news outlets that were allowed to ask questions at his news conferences.\nMr. Obama often chastised reporters, including Mr. Acosta on one occasion, for questions he deemed overly aggressive or grandstanding.\nBut Mr. Trump, a devoted news consumer who relishes his coverage,

head of the Nation of Islam, has been back in the headlines after a previously unreleased photo of him with President Barack Obama was published in January and Mr. Farrakhan gave an anti-Semitic speech at his organization\u2019s annual convention last month.\nThe Feb. 25 speech, which was given at an event for Saviour\u2019s Day, a religious gathering of the Nation, ran for almost three hours.\nDuring it, Mr. Farrakhan said that the \u201cpowerful Jews\u201d were his enemies, and that Jews were \u201cresponsible for all of this filth and degenerate behavior that Hollywood is putting out turning men into women and women into men,\u201d as well as other incendiary remarks.\nA religious fundamentalist whose group has been condemned by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Mr. Farrakhan is fervently opposed to the legitimacy of the state of Israel, and his political positions regarding the country frequently spill over into bigoted remarks about Jews, which is why many public officials have avoided association with him.\nMr. Farrakhan has denied that he is anti-Semitic and has even said that his father may have been Jewish.\nMuch of the recent coverage has been focused on Tamika Mallory, one of the heads of the Women\u2019s March organization, who attended the Feb. 25 speech, and on Representative Danny Davis, a Democrat of Illinois, who defended Mr. Obama and Mr. Farrakhan after the photo came to light.\nTheir reluctance to condemn Mr. Farrakhan has led to criticism from across the ideological spectrum this week.\nWhat is the Nation of Islam?\nThe Nation of Islam is a political and religious movement that was started by W.D.\nFard Muhammad in 1931 and continued by Elijah Muhammad in 1933.\nIt first became prominent after a man named Malcolm Little joined the organization.\nEncouraged by Elijah Muhammad, he changed his last name to X and became a minister in the movement.\nEdward E. Curtis IV, the author of \u201cBlack Muslim Religion in the Nation of Islam,\u201d said that while estimates ranged wildly about how many bona fide members belonged to the Nation, he believes that there were tens of thousands of members in the 1960s and early 1970s.\nBut he said that millions of others sympathized with the movement\u2019s anticolonial stance and were inspired by its most famous member, Muhammad Ali.\nWho is Louis Farrakhan?\nBorn Louis Eugene Walcott in New York in 1933, Mr. Farrakhan joined the Nation of Islam in the mid-1950s and rose quickly within the organization, becoming close to Malcolm X.\nAfter the assassination of Malcolm X in 1965, he became one of the most powerful members of the Nation and its chief spokesman, the position that Malcolm X had held.\nThe Nation of Islam had gained followers around the nation in the 1940s and \u201950s by providing something of a religious answer to antiblack racism.\nIt was not widely recognized as an anti-Jewish organization during its early years (its early literature, though, focused on \u201cthe white man\u201d as \u201cthe white devil\u201d).\nBut in 1967, it became outspokenly and flagrantly anti-Zionist, in an expression of solidarity with Palestinians.\nThat political position became a vehicle for Mr. Farrakhan to express his anti-Semitism.\n(Among his more infamous comments is his 1984 description of Adolf Hitler as \u201ca very great man.\u201d)\nIn 1975, when Elijah Muhammad died, the Nation split into two factions.\nThe faction reconstituted under Mr. Farrakhan in the late 1970s retained the original name, though not the influence or support that it had when its leaders were Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali and Elijah Muhammad.\nMr. Curtis said that today the membership could be in the thousands, and there could even be as many as 10,000 followers.\nMr. Farrakhan, whose name, the Anti-Defamation League wrote after the February event, is \u201cvirtually synonymous with anti-Semitism,\u201d then drew national attention in 1984, when he exhorted his followers to support Jesse Jackson\u2019s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.\nIn a radio address, he urged listeners to \u201cmake an example\u201d of a Washington Post reporter who had reported that Mr. Jackson had used anti-Semitic terms in private.\nMr. Jackson repudiated Mr. Farrakhan, but the minister\u2019s support proved troublesome to his 1988 campaign as well.\nHe was back in the news in 1995 when he organized what became known as the \u201cMillion Man March,\u201d a political and religious revival event in Washington.\nWhy were Tamika Mallory and Danny Davis reluctant to denounce him?\nMs. Mallory, who declined to comment for this article, did not respond to calls to condemn Mr. Farrakhan, for whom she had expressed admiration in the past.\nOn March 3, she said on Twitter that someone had brought to her attention that she had yet to tweet \u201cmy absolute position on how wrong anti-Semitism is.\u201d A day later, she said that she was \u201ccommitted to ending anti-black racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia & transphobia,\u201d but did not mention Mr. Farrakhan.\nIn an essay posted Wednesday, she said that she had been attending Saviour\u2019s Day celebrations for over 30 years.\n\u201cIn that most difficult period of my life, it was the women of the Nation of Islam who supported me and I have always held them close to my heart for that reason,\u201d she said.\nThe essay did not mention Mr. Farrakhan.\nAsked what the appeal of Mr. Farrakhan\u2019s views might be to people like Ms. Mallory, religious scholars emphasized that the Nation of Islam is a religion and can provide comfort and aid to its adherents.\n\u201cFor those who find it appealing, it is a form of radical black self love that is willing to challenge any potential impediment to black freedom,\u201d Mr. Curtis said.\nYvonne Chireau, a professor of religion at Swarthmore who called Mr. Farrakhan\u2019s remarks about Jews \u201cunbelievably vile,\u201d emphasized that his fundamentalism was comparable to the fundamentalist views found in other religions.\nCoincidentally, the photo of Mr. Farrakhan and Mr. Obama had been published by the Trice Edney News Wire in January.\nThe News Wire reported that the picture had been taken by the photojournalist Askia Muhammad during a 2005 meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus and that Mr. Muhammad kept the photo under wraps so as not to hurt Mr. Obama\u2019s candidacy.\n(Mr. Muhammad, in a 2012 blog post, said that he was an admirer of Mr. Farrakhan and that the minister was not an anti-Semite.\nHe reaffirmed that he admired Mr. Farrakhan in an interview on Friday, though he said that the things the minister says about Jewish people \u201csometimes make me shudder.\u201d)\nKatie Hill, a spokeswoman for Mr. Obama, said on Friday: \u201cPresident Obama has denounced racism and anti-Semitism his entire life.\nThat includes his public and repeated repudiations of Louis Farrakhan\u2019s views over the years.\nToday is no different \u2014 he still rejects the harmful and divisive views Farrakhan continues to espouse.\u201d\nRepresentative Davis, who was interviewed by The Daily Caller, a conservative news site, after the photo emerged, called Mr. Farrakhan an \u201coutstanding human being,\u201d and later said he was not bothered by the leader\u2019s position on \u201cThe Jewish Question.\u201d\nAfter a monthlong backlash about that interview, largely in conservative media, Mr. Davis said in a statement to Forward on Thursday that \u201cI reject, condemn and oppose Minister Farrakhan\u2019s views and remarks regarding the Jewish people and the Jewish religion.\u201d\n", ["Repetition",

year-and-a-half for the Factory to roll out the old reliable \u201cmistranslation\u201d defense to explain away the infamous paragraph 303 of Amoris Laetita (AL), which reads as follows in the official English translation on the Vatican website:\nYet conscience can do more than recognize that a given situation does not correspond objectively to the overall demands of the Gospel.\nIt can also recognize with sincerity and honesty what for now is the most generous response which can be given to God, and come to see with a certain moral security that it is what God himself is asking amid the concrete complexity of one\u2019s limits, while yet not fully the objective ideal.\nIn other words, the conscience can \u201cinform\u201d a sinner that his continued sinning is not only acceptable to God but is even what God is asking \u201cfor now,\u201d given one\u2019s particular \u201climits.\u201d This outrageous proposition, a form of situation ethics that strikes at the very foundation of Catholic moral teaching, has justly provoked a storm of criticism from lay and clerical defenders of the authentic Magisterium.\nBut it\u2019s all a misunderstanding, say Dr. Robert Fastiggi, professor of Systematic Theology at Sacred Heart Major Seminary, and Dr.\nDawn Eden Goldstein, S.T.D., professor of Dogmatic Theology at Holy Apostles College and Seminary.\nAll of the critics of AL are wrong\u2014every one of them!\u2014because, you see, the original Latin text does not say what the English text does.\nDr. Robert Fastiggi and Dr.\nDawn Goldstein\nHere we go again.\nSo what does the Latin say?\nHere is the paragraph in the official Latin:\nHaec autem conscientia agnoscere potest non modo statum quendam ab universali Evangelii mandato obiective dissidere; etiam sincere honesteque agnoscere poteste quod sit liberale responsum in praesenti Deo reddendum atque eadem conscientia firma quadam morali certitudine intellegere illam esse oblationem quam ipse Deus requirit inter rerum impedientium congeriem, quamvis perfectum nondum sit obiectivum exemplar.\nYes, and so what?\nWell, according to Fastiggi and Goldstein, while the English translation reads: \u201cwhat for now is the most generous response which can be given to God,\u201d the Latin employs the word oblationem, which means offering.\nSo, What the Pope Really Means\u00ae is: \u201cwhat for now is the most generous offering which can be given to God.\u201d So, it\u2019s an offering to God, not a response to God.\nBig difference.\nBut just a moment: how can objectively immoral behavior ever be characterized as an \u201coffering\u201d to God?\nIt would seem the Latin version has graver implications than the English because it suggests that falling short of what the moral law requires is an oblation pleasing to God if one\u2019s \u201climits\u201d make obedience to the moral law difficult.\nAnd that is exactly the nonsense Fastiggi and Goldstein expect us to swallow: \u201cPope Francis is not talking about an offering of an objectively sinful action but a gift of self that moves toward God and the objective moral norm.\u201d\nSo, our intrepid presenters of What the Pope Really Means\u00ae would have us believe that objectively immoral behavior, which is the best one can do according \u201cthe \u201cconcrete complexity of one\u2019s limits,\u201d is no longer simply objectively immoral behavior but rather a gift of self because it moves toward morally licit behavior.\nFastiggi and Goldstein have managed to make the problem even worse in their attempt to explain it away.\nWhat about the English locution \u201cwhile yet not fully the objective ideal,\u201d which seems to reduce the negative precepts of the natural law to mere ideals?\nNot so, Fastiggi and Goldstein contend.\nDo not all those ignorant critics of AL know that the Latin text employs the phrase \u201cobiectivum exemplar,\u201d which, translated literally into English is \u201cobjective exemplar.\u201d They declare triumphantly: \u201cThe Latin term exemplar does not mean an unattainable ideal, it specifically means a pattern or model to follow.\u201d\nGive.\nMe.\nA.\nBreak.\nA pattern or model to follow is an ideal, as a standard Latin dictionary confirms with its definition of exemplar: \u201c(1) copy/reproduction, (2) model, pattern, example, original, ideal.\nLikewise, the definition of the English word \u201cexemplar\u201d is simply: \u201can ideal model.\u201d\nHere too Fastiggi and Goldsetein only worsen the problem they try to explain away.\nFor if moral behavior is now to be viewed as merely \u201cexemplary\u201d rather than divinely mandated by the natural law that binds all men\u2014including Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery\u2014then basic morality becomes a kind of heroic virtue.\nThus, continence cannot realistically be expected, at least \u201cfor now\u201d (AL 303), of the average Joe or Jane with an \u201cex\u201d who has \u201cremarried\u201d and is now mired in the \u201cconcrete complexity one\u2019s limits.\u201d\nSo, as Fastiggi and Goldstein would have it, all the tumult triggered by AL is just a misunderstanding caused by uninformed people who haven\u2019t consulted the Latin text\u2014including those ignorant Vatican translators.\nAccording to their proposed \u201calternate translation\u201d into English, What the Pope Really Means\u00ae is that objectively immoral behavior one feels unable to correct due to one\u2019s \u201climits\u201d is \u201cthe offering that God himself is asking amid the mass of impediments, although it may not yet be the perfect objective model.\u201d Which is what the official English translation already says but with fewer words.\nIt seems Fastiggi and Goldstein are hoping no one will notice that their linguistic tinkering produces no real change in meaning but only an intensification of its perniciousness.\nIndeed, their \u201cproposed alternate translation\u201d reduces the avoidance of adulterous relations in \u201csecond marriages\u201d to the \u201cperfect objective model.\u201d Now, how could anyone but a Pharisee expect perfection from people living in adultery?\nAre you perfect?\nThen again, the Pharisees are precisely the ones Our Lord condemned for accommodating divorce and remarriage in violation of the natural law.\nBut such embarrassing truths need not impede the Bergoglian Mercy Train as it barrels toward a train wreck at the end of the line.\nAnd Fastiggi and Goldstein are busily helping it along, changing red signals to green.\nNo problem here!\nhas been the mantra of the neo-Catholic establishment for nearly half a century of ecclesial auto-demolition.\nBut wait, there\u2019s more!\nOur dynamic translators even provide their own dynamic interpretation of AL to mean that the \u201coffering\u201d to God of which Francis speaks is merely the decision by a divorced and \u201cremarried\u201d couple with children not to end their relationship, which would be the \u201cperfect objective model,\u201d but rather to \u201clive in continence until they may\u2014after the hoped for declaration of nullity\u2014enter into a true marriage.\u201d That is, they would have Francis affirming John Paul II\u2019s Familiaris consortio, which repeats the Church\u2019s constant teaching that continence is required of those who have entered into adulterous \u201csecond marriage,\u201d failing which they cannot be admitted to the sacraments.\nBut the Fastiggi-Goldstein interpretation is precisely the contrary of the interpretation Francis has assiduously promoted and which Fastiggi and Goldstein just as assiduously ignore: i.e., that people in \u201csecond marriages\u201d do not have to live in continence, but rather\u2014in \u201ccertain cases\u201d\u2014may continue their adulterous relations while receiving absolution and Holy Communion during a \u201cprocess of discernment.\u201d As we know, in his letter to the bishops of Buenos Aires, published on the Vatican website (in response to a query he himself may have solicited), Bergoglio informed them \u201cthere is no other interpretation.\u201d\nMoreover, the Maltese bishops' \u201cguidelines\u201d for implementing AL, published in L\u2019Osservatore Romano\u2014for which Bergoglio thanked them\u2014declare thus:\nIf, as a result of the process of discernment, undertaken with \u201chumility, discretion and love for the Church and her teaching, in a sincere search for God\u2019s will and a desire to make a more perfect response to it\u201d (AL 300), a separated or divorced person who is living in a new relationship manages, with an informed and enlightened conscience, to acknowledge and believe that he or she are at peace with God, he or she cannot be precluded from participating in the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist (see AL, notes 336 and 351).\nThis Pope\u2019s plan of promulgating a deliberately ambiguous document whose heterodox interpretation and application he would later approve with a series of sub-magisterial winks and nods, both oral and written, is the reason I signed onto the Correctio Filialis.\nSee the piece by Joseph Shaw in this regard.\nShaw maintains that AL can be \u201cbent into some kind of orthodoxy.\u201d Perhaps.\nBut it is not our responsibility to bend a Pope\u2019s statements into conformity with the Faith.\nMoreover, any Pope who promulgates a document that can be read as orthodox only by a forced interpretation imposed by certain readers\u2014while others disagree\u2014has by that very fact inflicted grave harm upon on the Church, which he alone has the duty to correct.\nBut Francis, as any reasonable observer can see, has no intention of offering any such correction.\nQuite to the contrary, confusion as a cover for the introduction of Holy Communion for \u201ccertain\u201d public adulterers by Bergoglio\u2019s co-conspirators in the Vatican and various dioceses is exactly what he was aiming to achieve from the beginning of the whole synodal charade, which was merely a vehicle for promulgation of AL.\nAs Shaw observes of AL: \u201cWhat we [the signers of the Correctio] are saying is that it has become clear that orthodoxy is not what Pope Francis wants us to find there.\u201d\nIn a sense, what Bergoglio is doing is worse than explicit heresy, which could at least be readily identified and denounced as such.\nBut Bergoglio wants the effects of heresy\u2014undermining Holy Matrimony, Confession and Holy Communion, whose integrity is affirmed verbally\u2014without the guilt of an explicit promulgation.\nIn so acting, he is very much in the mold of Honorius I, who was posthumously anathematized by an ecumenical council (the Third Council of Constantinople) and by his own successor (Leo II) for aiding and abetting the spread of the Monothelite heresy (no human but only a divine will in Christ).\nHonorius did so by means of private correspondence with the author of the heresy, endorsing the heresy without ever formally proclaiming it as doctrine.\nAnd yet Honorius I is listed in the canon of the Popes and is not considered to have fallen from office on account of heresy.\nA similar judgment might well befall this Pope, but it is not for us to level it.\nMeanwhile, as Fastiggi and Goldstein labor to convince us that nothing is amiss with AL, Pope Bergoglio is sending clear signals of concern about the rising opposition among the faithful to his master plan to subvert the Church according to his false notion of mercy.\nIn a classic power move, he has just given a sop to Cardinal Burke, the perceived leader of the opposition, by appointing him to a minor position on the Apostolic Signatura\u2014the same tribunal from which Bergoglio brutally removed him as Prefect.\nAnd this after also humiliating Burke as the spiritual patron of the Knights of Malta, to which he was exiled after his removal.\nWill this sop buy Burke\u2019s silence, staving off the feared public correction?\nWe will soon know if the Cardinal can be bought so easily.\nBut this move demonstrates\u2014if more evidence were needed\u2014that Bergoglio has never been the humble apostle of mercy depicted in his carefully crafted public relations narrative, but rather a cunning ecclesiastical politician, constantly plotting and scheming to get what he wants.\nThat the neo-Catholic establishment refuses to recognize the grim reality of this unprecedented pontificate is but another page in the long annals of its shameful defense of the indefensible to the detriment of Holy Mother Church.\n", ["Thought-terminating_Cliches", "Appeal_to_fear-prejudice", "Loaded_Language",

Iraq into a virtual vassal state of the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the process.\nObama's disastrous nuclear deal with Iran legitimized Iran's path to eventually becoming a nuclear-armed state, while immediately filling its coffers with billions of dollars to fund its aggression.\nMeanwhile, Syria has become ground zero for Iran's execution of its regional ambitions, which is to establish its Shiite Crescent connecting with its allies, including Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.\nThis plan has included the establishment of a land route that Iranian-backed militias secured in June, beginning on Iran\u2019s border with Iraq and running across Iraq and Syria all the way to Syria\u2019s Mediterranean coast.\nThis road makes Iran\u2019s job easier in supplying arms by land, as well as by air and sea, to prop up Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime and to equip Iran\u2019s own forces fighting inside of Syria in support of Assad.\nThis helps explain why Iran has placed so much importance on helping the Syrian regime establish control over the Deir ez-Zor area in eastern Syria, near the Iraqi border.\n\u201cEverything depends now on the Americans\u2019 willingness to stop this,\u201d said an Iraqi Kurdish official who was quoted in a New Yorker article.\nHowever, U.S.-led coalition forces apparently have done next to nothing to stop this major advance in Iran\u2019s Shiite Crescent expansion.\n\u201cObama ran down our options in Syria so thoroughly, by the time this administration took over,\u201d said Andrew Tabler, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n\u201cThe Iranian influence is spreading because they are so heavily involved in regime activities,\u201d Tabler added.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new monster.\u201d\nFurthermore, Iran has funded and armed its terrorist proxy Hezbollah, which has sent its militia from its home base of Lebanon to fight alongside Assad's forces.\nAnd Iran has used Syria as a transit point for shipment of sophisticated rockets to Hezbollah in Lebanon for future use against Israeli population centers.\nDespite the fact that Hezbollah has American blood on its hands, the U.S.-led coalition has chosen not to do anything about Hezbollah\u2019s presence in Syria, bought and paid for by Iran.\nWhile Israel chose not to take sides in Syria's civil war with military intervention of its own, it has bombed weapons storage facilities and convoys inside Syria for its own protection.\nJust recently, on September 7th, Israeli jets struck a Syrian weapons facility near Masyaf, which was reported to have been used for the production of chemical weapons and the storage of missiles.\nIsrael will also do what is necessary to repel Iranian-backed forces if they edge too close to areas near the Golan Heights, shrinking the buffer between Israel and Iranian controlled territories.\nHowever, such tactical measures may not be enough to thwart Iran\u2019s larger ambitions.\nIn light of intelligence reports that Assad may be ready to invite Iran to set up military bases in Syria, Israeli leaders have concluded that they cannot wait until the Trump administration decides to deal more forcefully with Iran's growing use of Syria as a staging area for carrying out its expansionist Shiite Crescent strategy.\n\u201cTheir overriding concern in Syria is the free reign that all the major players there seem willing to afford Iran and its various proxies in the country,\u201d wrote Jonathan Spyer in an article for Foreign Policy.\nAs long as nobody else is addressing the concern Iran\u2019s growing control raises in a satisfactory manner, \u201cIsrael is determined to continue addressing it on its own.\u201d\nAt least, Israel has a more sympathetic ear in the Trump administration than it did in the Obama administration for raising its concerns about Iran\u2019s growing threat, not only to Israel but to U.S. interests in the region and beyond.\nPresident Trump\u2019s sharp denunciation of the Iranian regime during his address to the UN General Assembly represented a welcome departure from the Obama administration\u2019s milquetoast approach to Iran.\nAs the U.S.-led coalition continues to drive ISIS from its bases of operation in Syria, the Trump administration has proclaimed its intention not to allow Iran to turn Syria into its own satellite, as Iran has essentially done in Iraq.\nNational Security Adviser H.R.\nMcMaster said that the \u201cso called liberation of areas by Assad\u2019s forces and Iranian proxies could actually accelerate the cycle of violence and perpetuate conflict rather than get us to a sustainable outcome.\u201d He claimed that the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cobjectives are to weaken Iranian influence across the region broadly,\u201d without discussing the means to accomplish those objectives.\nWhether the Trump administration follows through remains to be seen.\nIn the meantime, Israel will have to deal with the fallout of Iran\u2019s ambitions in Syria itself.\n", ["Appeal_to_fear-prejudice", "Doubt", "Exaggeration,Minimisation", "Loaded_Language",

left in the hotel room while other assailants carried out the shooting.\nThe caller mentioned how some people in the crowd were warned 45 minutes before the shooting that they were going to die, suggesting that this was evidence of a wider plot and not a \u201clone wolf\u201d attack.\nAs a firearms expert, he also questioned the lack of flashes coming from the hotel windows where the shooter was supposedly firing from.\nRick said he had already contacted the Clark County Sheriff\u2019s Office to relay all the information he knew.\nAlthough the claims are intriguing, it is important to remember that after virtually every terror attack and mass shooting, friends and neighbors express shock that the culprit would be capable of carrying out such horrors, with some outright denying it to be possible.\nIf Paddock was planning such a sophisticated operation and hoping to evade detection, he would not be blabbing details about it to his neighbors.\nHowever, the neighbor\u2019s claims

Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is an investigative journalist and writer focusing on the radical left and Islamic terrorism.\nThe American Jewish Historical Society was founded to study and preserve Jewish history.\nThese days it\u2019s instead partnering with Jewish Voice for Peace: an anti-Israel BDS hate group that defends anti-Semitism and which sponsored talks by an anti-Semite who accused Jews of drinking blood.\nThe fruits of the AJHS and JVP partnership have been a series of events attacking Israel.\nComing up in late October is \u201cThe Balfour Declaration: Support for a Jewish Homeland or Jewish State?\u201d\nThe two speakers are Robert Herbst, the coordinator of the Westchester chapter of JVP, and Jonathan Kuttab, who advocates a one-state solution for eliminating Israel.\nHe had tweeted, \"EU no longer considers #Hamas a terrorist group.\nTime for US to do same.\"\nKuttab has defended Islamic anti-Semitism by claiming that the \u201cdistrust Moslems feel towards Jews\u201d is due to \u201ctwo acts of betrayal by Jewish tribes against the Prophet.\u201d And that Jews suffer from a \u201cHolocaust Syndrome\u201d of entitlement.\nHe justified hijacking planes, described suicide bombers as \u201ctaking the supreme sacrifice\u201d and defended Hezbollah as \u201can armed-resistance movement\u201d\nHe has claimed that the \"Jewish community gradually consolidated its power, wealth, and influence in all sectors of society\" especially in \"crucial sectors like banking, finance, media\u201d where \"their influence both as individuals and an organized community far exceeded their numbers\" and that their power strengthens \u201cconspiracy theories about \u2018Jewish control\u2019 that are reminiscent of the infamous

co-sponsoring a JVP anti-Israel event by two opponents of Israel, one of whom has defended Hamas.\nAn organization that hands out the Emma Lazarus Award, named after a passionate Zionist, at its posh dinners is hosting attacks on the existence of Israel.\nThe \u201cJewish Homeland\u201d or \u201cJewish State\u201d argument is a hook for contending that the Balfour Declaration didn\u2019t endorse Israel, but some sort of Jewish Bantustan within a Muslim country.\nThat worked so well for the Christians and Jews of the Middle East.\nThe American Jewish Historical Society is not only co-sponsoring a one-state event by an anti-Israel hate group.\nBut it\u2019s also hosting it at the Center for Jewish History\u2019s headquarters.\nAJHS is a component of the Center for Jewish History.\nAnd the partnership between AJHS and JVP sheds light on the controversy over the appointment of David N. Myers, an anti-Israel activist, to head the Center for Jewish History.\nDuring the Myers controversy, the Center took pains to disassociate Myers and themselves from JVP because a JVP handout had listed him as a \u201cJVP Academic Advisory Board Member.\u201d But in reality the Center, through AJHS, has an ongoing relationship with JVP.\nThe Balfour event was not AJHS\u2019 only partnership with JVP.\nIn December, the AJHS will feature \u201cRubble Rubble\u201d, a play by Dan Fishback based on his trip to Israel.\nFishback is a BDS supporter and a member of the JVP Artists Council.\nHis goal is to \u201cnormalize Jewish anti-Zionism\u201d.\nAJHS and JVP members get discounted admission.\nThe venue is once again the Center for Jewish History.\nSpecifically the Leo and Julia Forchheimer Auditorium at CJH.\nLeo Forchheimer\u2019s philanthropy had left its mark on Israel.\nWhat would he think if he knew the anti-Israel purposes that CJH is putting his gift to?\nA third AJHS-JVP event featured Efrat Yerday, an anti-Israel activist, accusing Israel of racism.\nEfrat has claimed that, \"Zionism does not only dispossess Palestinians, but it also dispossesses in a very sophisticated way, non-white Jews.\nBeing Jewish is highly identified with being white because of Zionism.\"\nAJHS will claim that it is only offering different perspectives.\nBut when it comes to Israel, there\u2019s only one perspective.\n\u201cBalfour\u201d and \u201cRubble Rubble\u201d are to be part of AJHS\u2019 \u201c1917: How One Year Changed the World\u201d.\nThe exhibition is supposed to cover WWI, the Bolshevik Revolution, and the Balfour Declaration.\nBut the only Balfour program on the list questions whether Israel should even exist.\nThe exhibition closes with Fishback\u2019s anti-Israel agenda.\nAnd these are the only listed AJHS programs that focus on Israel.\nJVP is also the only organization that AJHS chooses to partner with on political events.\nThe American Jewish Historical Society appears to be uninterested in holding any pro-Israel events.\nIt\u2019s uninterested in partnering with pro-Israel groups.\nInstead it\u2019s providing a forum for a BDS hate group.\nAnd it\u2019s no mystery why.\nThe AJHS Academic Council is packed with anti-Israel activists.\nLila Corwin-Berman, the chair of the AJHS Academic Council who also serves on its board of trustees, is a member of the Open Hillel Academic Council.\nOpen Hillel seeks to \"open\" the campus group to BDS and other anti-Israel views.\nBerman has defended the anti-Israel hate group IfNotNow, which employs JVP tactics, and condemned efforts to fight BDS.\nShe signed a petition in support of BDS activists being allowed to enter Israel.\nOther AJHS Academic Council members who signed the pro-BDS activist petition include Ari Kelman, Riv-Ellen Prell, Deborah Dash Moore, Rachel Kranson, Libby Garland and Kirsten Fermaglich.\nWhen we look at what is going on in CJH\u2019s components like the AJHS, the elevation of David N. Myers to head CJH is unsurprising.\nMyers is a symptom of the problem.\nAs is AJHS\u2019s partnership with JVP.\nA great deal of shocking behavior is taking place inside Jewish organizations whose inner workings most people in the Jewish community generally pay very little attention to.\nUnlike CJH, the American Jewish Historical Society is an organization that dates back to the 19th century.\nIts perversion by the radical anti-Jewish and anti-Israel left to serve anti-Semitic narratives is tragic.\nAnd yet it\u2019s inescapable.\nEven as the Myers scandal continues to simmer, the AJHS partnership with JVP is making the choice painfully clear.\nThe radical anti-Israel left will not be satisfied with embedding \u201cmoderate\u201d opposing voices into Jewish organizations.\nInstead it seeks to normalize the furthest extremes of anti-Israel hatred.\nAnd it will not be satisfied with anything less.\nDuring the Myers controversy, defenders of his appointment, including some figures named here, claimed that it was an issue of apolitical scholarship.\nIs co-sponsoring events with a hate group that has sponsored talks by a woman who accused Jews of drinking blood also apolitical scholarship?\nThe anti-Israel leftists at the AJHS are clearly not leaving their politics at home.\nAnd support for them and for Myers cannot be distinguished from support for their views.\nNot when JVP is at AJHS.\nWe all have choices to make.\nSometimes the choices are murky.\nOther times they are simple and easy.\nWhen the American Jewish Historical Society hosts and co-sponsors an event by a BDS hate group attacking the existence of Israel and featuring a speaker who had defended terrorism and anti-Semitism, the choice becomes easy.\nEither you stand with BDS, Hamas, blood libels and those who want to destroy Israel or with Jews.\nAs the anti-Israel radicalism of the left grows, such choices will become even more obscenely simple.\nBut they will not be any less difficult.\nOpposing the anti-Israel left makes many important enemies and wins few friends.\nThe anti-Israel left has built networks that can blacklist, smear and silence almost anyone in an academic field.\nSpeaking out against hate is easiest when it\u2019s weakest.\nIt\u2019s hardest when it\u2019s strongest.\nWhen we think about Nazi Germany, we remember those who spoke out.\nWe don\u2019t remember those who were too intimidated and uncertain to rise against anti-Semitism when they saw it and heard it.\nHistory tells us why so many people are afraid to do the right thing when it counts.\nIt also tells us how irrelevant history makes them.\nThere are lessons here for the Center for Jewish History and the American Jewish Historical Society, for those on the inside who see the corruption of their organizations every day and for those on the outside who are worried about speaking up.\nThere are lessons here for all of us.\nIf you can\u2019t speak out against the

Curate: The Attack on Marriage is an Attack on Christ in the Eucharist\nPope Paul VI\u2019s 1965 encyclical on the Eucharist, \u201cMysterium Fidei,\u201d was the first place I saw anyone say that the body and blood, soul and complete divinity of Christ was actually present in the consecrated species.\nHaving been raised in Remi de Roo\u2019s Victoria in the 1970s, I had naturally never heard anything at all about the Eucharist.\nThe understanding that Catholics believed what they believe about it came as a bit of a shock.\n(Read the full document here. )\nWith the hindsight of 52 years and a great deal of very dirty and unappealing water under the Catholic bridge, we can see it as a kind of warning prophecy.\nPublished just three months before the close of Vatican II and just as Annibale Bugnini was cranking open the floodgates of his never-ending stream of liturgical alterations, Mysterium Fidei is now an important marker of a critical turning point in Catholic history, perhaps the most important of modern times.\nWho can read this without cringing at what we now know was about to happen:\nTherefore, we earnestly hope that the restored sacred liturgy will bring forth abundant fruits of eucharistic devotion, so that the Holy Church, under this saving sign of piety, may make daily progress toward perfect unity and may invite all Christians to a unity of faith and of love, drawing them gently, thanks to the action of divine grace.\nBut in 1983 at the start of my personal investigations into the Catholic religion, I knew nothing of any of that.\nThe encyclical, the very first I ever read, was also a marker for me of a personal turning point.\nIt was the first time I had ever seen Catholic eucharistic doctrine clearly and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 unapologetically stated.\nIt came right out and said something so astounding, something so completely unlikely, that I had to admit that it left very few logical possibilities.\nLike C.S.\nLewis\u2019s assessment of the claims by Christ of His own divinity, this pope was either mad, bad or telling the plain truth.\nSomething that may be much more noteworthy now in our current circumstances than it was the year I read it, is that the pope\u2019s very first quote was not of scripture, but the Council of Trent:\n\u201cAt the Last Supper, on the night He was handed over, Our Lord instituted the Eucharistic Sacrifice of His Body and Blood, to perpetuate the sacrifice of the cross throughout the ages until He should come, and thus entrust to the Church, His beloved spouse, the memorial of His death and resurrection: a sacrament of devotion, a sign of unity, a bond of charity, a paschal banquet in which Christ is received, the soul is filled with grace and there is given to us the pledge of future glory.\u201d\nIn these words are highlighted both the sacrifice, which pertains to the essence of the Mass which is celebrated daily, and the sacrament in which the faithful participate in Holy Communion by eating the Flesh of Christ and drinking His Blood, receiving both grace, the beginning of eternal life, and the medicine of immortality.\nI remember my thoughts upon reading this shocking statement\u2026 \u201cBy doing what?\n!\u201d\nMy acceptance from the reading of this document of the Church\u2019s orthodox eucharistic doctrine was based in part on Pope Paul\u2019s gracious and beautiful exposition, and in part on the sheer radical, mad unlikeliness of it.\nWhat could conceivably be the reason to say anything as wild as this if it weren\u2019t true?\nThe idea of transubstantiation struck me as I read that document as possibly the strangest and most earth shattering thing I\u2019d ever heard.\nIt shocked me out of a kind of swamp of intellectual worldliness; presenting the idea to my thirsty mind that there could indeed be fantastic realities far more wonderful than the banal and painfully uninteresting secularist worldview I had been taught to accept.\nIt was as though someone had plausibly told me that, yes, there were fairies and magical kingdoms in real life, \u201cjust around the corner\u201d.\nBy the time I read it, I had been through a long, slow transition from a childhood devoted to Our Lady and confirmed in my belief in wonders, to a kind of disappointed practical atheism after three years in a diocesan Catholic parochial school.\nI had been taught, by both word and implication, that everything the Catholic Church had taught before Vatican II was pernicious nonsense.\nWhere it was simply wrong it was ridiculous and where it was wrong and political it was outright wicked.\nWhat led me to read that particular encyclical is the most clearly identifiable moment of actual grace in my young life to that point.\nIt was the first time it occurred to me to investigate, like an anthropologist, what the Church herself said about her teachings.\nWhile mulling grimly one day over all the wickedness of the Catholic Church, I was pulled up short by a single thought: \u201cI could be wrong.\u201d At 17 it seemed such an unlikely thing to think I was rather shocked.\nBut stopping a moment to consider, I realised that I had only ever heard about Catholic things from people who clearly hated the Church; her enemies, in short.\nIt hardly seemed just to convict on the testimony of these obviously biased witnesses.\nIn order to properly and thoroughly condemn the Church, with convincing due diligence, I had to read something about it that didn\u2019t come from her enemies.\nThe same day, I presented myself at the reference desk of the public library and asked, \u201cDo you have any books about Catholicism?\nSomething official?\u201d The librarian took me to the reference section and showed me the shelves of encyclicals, documents and histories.\nSaints and popes from one end of the stacks to the other.\nHaving no clear idea what my own question meant, I just picked one at random.\nThe description of the Holy Eucharist as the supreme Centre from which all our life as Catholics flow, and from which all other doctrines radiated, was something that was not going to come into my head for another eight years of reading.\nBut even so, Mysterium Fidei forced me to face up to a reality I\u2019d never dreamed of before; that this, the little unassuming wafer, was the most important thing in the world.\nReading through the encyclical again, holding it up next to the current situation in Rome, makes it easier to clarify certain critical issues.\nGiven what we are now seeing, consider the poignancy of the following passages:\nWhen dealing with the restoration of the sacred liturgy, the Fathers of the council, by reason of their pastoral concern for the whole Church, considered it of the highest importance to exhort the faithful to participate actively with sound faith and with the utmost devotion in the celebration of this Most Holy Mystery, to offer it with the priest to God as a sacrifice for their own salvation and for that of the whole world, and to find in it spiritual nourishment.\nThis was, remember, 1965, four years before the New Mass was issued and before Cardinal Ottaviani warned the pope that it was precisely this sacramental reality that was about to be catastrophically obscured.\nWho, reading this passage, does not feel the urge to shout down the years, to do something to stave off the disaster that was coming:\n[W]e are aware of the fact that, among those who deal with this Most Holy Mystery in written or spoken word, there are some who with reference either to Masses which are celebrated in private, or to the dogma of transubstantiation, or to devotion to the Eucharist, spread abroad opinions which disturb the faithful and fill their minds with no little confusion about matters of faith.\nIt is as if everyone were permitted to consign to oblivion doctrine already defined by the Church, or else to interpret it in such a way as to weaken the genuine meaning of the words or the recognized force of the concepts involved.\nKeeping Cardinal Ottaviani\u2019s Intervention directly before our thoughts, we read with a strange kind of helpless dread\u2026\n\u2026it is not allowable to emphasize what is called the \u201ccommunal\u201d Mass to the disparagement of Masses celebrated in private, or to exaggerate the element of sacramental sign as if the symbolism, which all certainly admit in the Eucharist, expresses fully and exhausts completely the mode of Christ\u2019s presence in this sacrament.\nNor is it allowable to discuss the mystery of transubstantiation without mentioning what the Council of Trent stated about the marvelous conversion of the whole substance of the bread into the Body and of the whole substance of the wine into the Blood of Christ, speaking rather only of what is called \u201ctransignification\u201d and \u201ctransfiguration,\u201d or finally to propose and act upon the opinion according to which, in the Consecrated Hosts which remain after the celebration of the sacrifice of the Mass, Christ Our Lord is no longer present.\n[\u2026]\nAnd therefore, so that the hope aroused by the council, that a flourishing of eucharistic piety which is now pervading the whole Church, be not frustrated by this spread of false opinions, we have with apostolic authority decided to address you, venerable brothers, and to express our mind on this subject.\n[1]\nThose of us writing similar jeremiads now have been working to clarify that the attack from Rome on the moral doctrine of the Church isn\u2019t about marriage.\nIt\u2019s about the Eucharist and to a lesser extent the priesthood.\nThe demonic forces we know are the driving force behind this supreme moment of heresy and destruction aren\u2019t really looking at the undermining of marriage as their primary goal; they want to get at the Eucharist.\nWe know it is demonically inspired because their hatred is for Christ Himself in the first place and for anyone who loves and wants to serve Him second.\nThey are men who refuse to bend the knee before the God whom they will not serve.\nThis knowledge \u2013 that the attack is on the Body and Blood of Christ \u2013 can also help readers spot their friends in the crowd.\nThe places where Eucharistic adoration is still offered are places where at least some flicker of the true Faith survives.\nThe bishops and priests now talking about the supreme glory of the Eucharist, and the need to defend it from sacrilege, are lighthouses.\nA case in point is Bishop Mark Davies, of my own former diocese of Shrewsbury in England.\nIn March, 2016, in the midst of the shouting from Rome, Bishop Davies spoke at his Chrism Mass said that only through the \u201creality of the Eucharist\u201d could new vocations to the priesthood be found.\n\u201cIn treasuring this gift of priestly celibacy we need to recognize more clearly the intimate link between the Ministerial Priesthood and the reality of the Eucharist.\nIf the Mass were ever reduced in our minds to being merely a commemorative meal and the priest as only a community leader or functionary, then the celibacy of the Catholic Priesthood might seem extravagant.\u201d\nIt\u2019s almost as if someone had slipped a copy of the Ottaviani Intervention inside his morning paper.\nThe targeting of marriage, through the instruments of creatures like the myopic and theologically tunnel-visioned Cardinal Kasper, is demonically brilliant.\nIt\u2019s a \u201cstitch-up\u201d as the English call it; a fix.\nYou make it a matter of \u201cmercy\u201d (backed up by the iron fist) that no one in a state of objective mortal sin can be refused Holy Communion; you give the national bishops conferences the power to start enforcing this, and you have created a previously unimaginable situation in the Church.\nYou have created a regime in which a refusal to desecrate the sacred species will be grounds for persecution of faithful priests, seminarians and laity.\nAnd of course, we are seeing it starting already.\nIt\u2019s a brilliant strategy, the magic bullet that will revert the Church to the 1976 model on every front, and very likely keep it there forever.\nAs if the goal was to go back in time and erase the entire John Paul II/Benedict XVI period out of history.\nIt will halt the revival of eucharistic piety among seminarians; in fact, it will reverse the general reforming trend of \u201cconservative\u201d seminaries that was such a feature under John Paul II and has for 30 years been the hook upon which all hopes of restoration have hung.\nIt is easy to see what is coming next.\nOnce certain announcements are published in parish bulletins, laity will have to consider whether they can, in conscience, continue to assist at Masses where systematic sacrilege has been formally adopted as the rule.\nThe few bishops with sufficient spine to stand up to the pressure of both Rome and their own national conferences \u2013 newly empowered with directives to make doctrinal declarations \u2013 will be ruling embattled islands of Catholicism in a poisoned sea of systematic heresy and desecration.\nA dark, impenetrable and \u201cirreversible\u201d winter of persecution of the faithful by their own shepherds will fall.\nNot being a theologian I have no idea if this encyclical is, as so many of these seemingly orthodox documents of that period seem to be, rife with the usual \u201ctime bombs,\u201d ambiguities, mushy language or even outright errors.\nI haven\u2019t looked it up.\nI\u2019m sure there are plenty of people out there qualified to examine it to see if it\u2019s safe for Trad-Catholic consumption.\nAnd I have no doubt at all that there are better, more venerable, even more sublime and poignant works on the Eucharist in the canon of \u201cofficial\u201d things.\nFrom saints and Doctors of the Church and whatnot, many of which the pope cited.\nBut whatever its flaws, Mysterium Fidei is the one I found, and I\u2019m convinced it wasn\u2019t an accident.\nO God, in Your infinite mercy, forgive and have mercy on Pope Paul VI Montini for whatever neglect or damage of which he may have been guilty.\nIn this one case at least, a work of his was the exact right thing at the exact right time.\nFor me at least it was the key that opened the Door to Narnia.\n____________________\n[1] The fact that four years before the New Mass was issued, Paul VI was pinpointing in such detail exactly what Bugnini and co. were preparing makes it all but impossible to escape the conclusion that he knew perfectly well what was coming but approved the disastrous New Rite anyway.\nAnd then did nothing but weep as the inevitable disaster unfolded.\n",

dead and hundreds injured is falling apart.\nFrom shooter Paddock\u2019s check-in date and the existence of a second person in his room, to possible connections to a terrorist organization, as well as the the actual timeline of events, everything being disseminated by law enforcement and the mainstream media should now come under public scrutiny.\nIn the last 24 hours the Sheriff\u2019s Department has significantly revised the event timeline and a key incident involving the shooting of a Mandalay Bay security guard.\nOriginally, as highlighted by The Daily Sheeple, the security guard was hailed as being responsible for preventing the shooter from continuing his massacre because he interrupted him in the middle of the attack.\nAs it turns out, security guard Jesus Campos was actually shot BEFORE Paddock opened fire on the concert crowd below his 32nd floor hotel suite.\nAs part of the constantly changing story, officials are now saying that police officers who rushed to the hotel room when the shooting began didn\u2019t know a hotel security guard had been shot \u201cuntil they met him in the hallway after exiting the elevator,\u201d Lombardo said.\nThe security guard, Jesus Campos, was struck in the leg as the gunman, from behind his door, shot into the hallway on the 32nd floor.\nPaddock apparently detected Campos via surveillance cameras he set up outside his hotel suite, police have said.\nPaddock shot the guard at 9:59 p.m. local time, Lombardo said, shortly before raining down bullets on the Route 91 Harvest festival in an attack that began at 10:05 p.m. and lasted 10 minutes.\nPolice officers found Campos when they arrived on the floor.\nAnd Campos did not summon police to the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, according to the timeline recently updated by the authorities.\nWhat\u2019s also incredibly interesting, is that eyewitnesses claim to have seen security guards chasing another security guard in the minutes leading up to the massacre.\nThe hotel guest in the room next to Paddock also saw \u201cmultiple gunmen.\u201d The Full Report: The Ever-Changing Vegas Narrative: Gunman Shot Security Guard Before Massacre\nAs of today, here is the revised timeline, as outlined by the Los Angeles Times:\nThe new timeline has left investigators and researchers with new questions, two of which are extremely important:\nWhat happened during the 6 minutes between Campos being shot and Paddock opening fire, and why weren\u2019t the police rushing to the scene immediately?\nWhy did shooter Stephen Paddock stop shooting?\nPaddock had already shot the security guard, waited six minutes before opening fire on the concert crowd, and then shot for a full ten minutes.\nPolice didn\u2019t arrive for two additional minutes after the shooting stopped \u2013 which is a full 18 minutes from the moment Campos was initially hit.\nMoreover, did he stop shooting because he was planning his escape from the 32nd floor?\nOr is it possible that Paddock was rushed and in a state of panic?\nAccording to links and information shared by Thomas Wictor and a timeline assessment by Twitter user Mr. Alex, the plausibility of Paddock accidentally killing himself amid the confusion, adrenaline and panic is quite high:\nLatest LV Sheriff: Saying they still don\u2019t know why he stopped

Ferrara\u2019s articles on Fastiggi and Goldstein\u2019s defense of Amoris Laetitia and their criticism of the Filial Correction:\nFastiggi\u2019s exchange with Ferrara concerning \u201cWait, Wait, It\u2019s all a mistranslation!\u201d\nRobert Fastiggi \u2022 13 hours ago\nIn the article that I co-authored with Dr. Goldstein, we would have done better to speak of the \u201cofficial\u201d Latin text rather than the \u201coriginal\u201d Latin text.\nThis, though, is no longer an issue because the normative text is the Latin text published in thr AAS.\nMr. Ferrara, however, bases his critique upon an assumption that the \u201cgenerous response\u201d offered to God is a sin.\nThis, though, is not what AL is saying.\nThe generous response is a move away from sin and a move toward God.\nI explain this in my most recent response to Prof. E. Christian Brugger, which can serve as my response to Mr. Ferrara:\nPosted on LifeSiteNews:\nProf. Brugger is a good theologian and a fine man, but he still seems to believe that AL 303 implies that God is asking people to continue to sin in some cases.\nIn his April 22, 2016 article in Catholic World Report, Brugger writes that AL 303 suggests that \u201cGod can be \u2018asking\u2019 someone to live in a life-state in which they are objectively violating grave matter.\u201d Then in a Sept. 28 \u201817 LifeSiteNews article, he states that \u201cthe generous response\u201d owed to God is \u201ca certain state that is objectively at variance with the universal command of the Gospel.\u201d Now Prof. Brugger argues that, because the subject remains \u201cthis conscience\u201d in AL 303, this proves that the \u201cgenerous offering owed to God\u201d is the recognition that one is living \u201ccontrary to \u201cthe universal command of the Gospel.\u201d\nProf. Brugger fails to see that AL 303 clearly distinguishes between a conscience\u2019s recognition that \u201ca given situation is objectively at variance with the general mandate of the Gospel\u201d and this same conscience\u2019s subsequent recognition of a \u201cgenerous response owed to God in the present circumstances.\u201d The subject \u201cconscience\u201d might be the same but the object is different.\nThe \u201cgenerous response\u201d is not the situation that is at variance with the command of the Gospel but an offering that God is asking amid the mass of impediments even though it may not yet be the perfect objective model.\nWhat might be this \u201cgenerous response?\u201d Pope Francis does not give an example in AL 303 because he\u2019s speaking in general terms of the dynamics of conscience.\nMoreover, he knows that concrete cases vary widely.\nIn our Sept. 26 article in La Stampa, Dr. Goldstein and I provided a hypothetical example of a couple in a purely civil \u201cmarriage\u201d recognizing that God is calling them to live in continence.\nWe chose this example deliberately to demonstrate that \u201cthe generous response\u201d could be the ending of a particular sin.\nOur example was an attempt to show that Professors Brugger and Seifert are wrong to believe AL 303 implies that God is asking some people to continue to live in an objectively sinful state.\nIt\u2019s really just the opposite.\nAL 303 teaches that conscience will come to recognize that God is asking for a step in the right direction away from sin.\nPope Francis explains this again in AL 305 when he says \u201ca small step, in the midst of great human limitations, can be more pleasing to God than a life which appears outwardly in order, but moves through the day without confronting great difficulties.\u2019\u201d\nIn a recent interview (http://www.lastampa.it/2017..., the Italian philosopher, Rocco Buttiglione, provides this example for AL 303: \u201cImagine a father who has a sick son and the child improves.\nHe still has fever but has stopped vomiting; the child manages to keep in his stomach what he eats and has started a therapy that seems to work.\nThe father is happy.\nIs he happy about the fact that the child is sick?\nNo, he is pleased that his son gives symptoms of improvement and healing.\u201d\nThis is what Pope Francis is saying in AL 303.\nGod is not happy with situations that are objectively at variance with the command of the Gospel.\nGod, however, is happy when people in such situations discern in conscience that He is asking them to make a choice that moves in the right direction\u2014even if they still need to progress further toward a more complete fulfillment of His will.\nThis is the law of gradualness not the gradualness of the law.\nIt is sad that this beautiful and compassionate message of AL 303 has been so completely misunderstood by scholars who have failed to grasp its true meaning.\nChris Ferrara to Robert Fastiggi \u2022 9 hours ago\nI certainly agree that the Latin text is the normative text even if it comes later.\nI certainly do not agree that the Latin text eliminates the grave problems with Amoris Laetitia.\nRather, as I show in my article, it only intensifies them.\nWith all due respect to Dr. Fastiggi, his argument and that of Buttiglione, that a \u201cmove away from sin\u201d is what is pleasing to God, even if the moral norm is not adhered to, is sophistical.\nWhat constitutes a \u201cmove away\u201d from sin if not ceasing to commit the sin?\nNo example is provided in AL because none can be.\nThe notion is nonsensical.\nJust how nonsensical is demonstrated by Dr. Fastiggi\u2019s claim that by \u201ca move away from sin\u201d in the case of a divorced and \u201cremarried\u201d couple Francis means their agreement to live in continence as brother and sister for the sake of children.\nBut that would be ceasing to commit the sin of adultery altogether as it would involve abandoning the pretense that they are married along with the illicit sexual relation itself.\nSuch a couple could always be absolved and receive Holy Communion under the Church\u2019s constant practice, albeit privately to avoid scandal.\nAt any rate, the \u201cbrother and sister\u201d approach to the situation, which is that of Familiaris consortio 84, is certainly not the one advocated by Francis.\nAs my article shows, Francis has made it quite clear that he approves of admitting to the sacraments divorced and \u201cremarried\u201d people who will continue to live as if they were married, including sexual relations, while \u201cdiscerning\u201d their situation, this \u201cdiscernment\u201d being a mere fig leaf to conceal the proposed toleration of public adultery in the Church.\nThus, Francis thanked the Maltese bishops for their AL guidelines, which literally mandate admission to the sacraments of divorced and \u201cremarried\u201d people who believe themselves to be \u201cat peace with God.\u201d And, as he told the bishops of Buenos Aires in writing, \u201cthere is no other interpretation.\u201d\nNo amount of verbal artifice can conceal what is happening in the Church thanks to AL: Public adulterers are being admitted to Holy Communion without an amendment of life and the bimillenial discipline of the Church---which John Paul insisted involves a moral norm, not a mere ecclesiastical law, to which everyone is bound in conscience \u201cwithout exception\u201d---is being overthrown in place after place.\nIt is a great disservice to the Church to maintain the pretense that there is nothing problematical about AL.\nA moral catastrophe is self-evidently underway and it is not possible honestly to deny its cause.\nRobert Fastiggi to Chris Ferrara \u2022 2 hours ago\nThank you for your response.\nYou write well but you do not reveal a proper understanding of what Pope Francis is saying in AL 303.\nI can only ask that you to study the matter more carefully with an open heart and mind.\nChris Ferrara to Robert Fastiggi \u2022 16 minutes ago\nTell that to the four cardinals, the 800,000 faithful, the 45 theologians and the 61 other original signers of the correctio, all of whom you insult with your superficial and I must say entirely sophistical attempt to explain away what Francis is clearly doing.\nIrony of ironies, the latter-day Pharisees and legalists Francis sees around every corner are hard at work defending Amoris Laetitia at the very moment it is being cited by bishop after bishop as their sole authority for admitting public adulterers to Holy Communion---while Francis does nothing but approve.\nI think you should follow your own advice about studying this matter with an open heart and mind, but above all with open eyes, for you have clearly shut them to what is going in the dioceses in the name of AL.\nFastiggi\u2019s exchange with Ferrara concerning \u201cMore Fake News: La Stampa Tries Again.\u201d\nRobert Fastiggi \u2022 12 hours ago\nI would like to thank Christopher Ferrara again for calling attention to an article I co-authored with Dr. Goldstein in La Stampa.\nI give him credit for his colorful style.\nUnfortunately, Mr. Ferrara provides no real evidence for his claim that Pope Francis \u201cwishes the bishops to admit public adulterers in 'second marriages' to the sacraments while continuing their adulterous relations.\u201d\nHe mentions the Holy Father's letter to the Buenos Aires bishops, but he fails to take into account that the statement of those Argentine bishops can be interpreted in an orthodox way, as Cardinal M\u00fcller told Edward Pentin in a Sept. 28 interview published in the National Catholic Register.\nIn fact the statement of the Argentine bishops only speaks of the possibility of \u201caccess to the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist.\u201d This could reasonably be interpreted as going to confession before receiving Holy Communion.\nThe same applies to statements of Pope Francis and Cardinal Schoenborn mentioned by Ferrara.\nPope Francis defers to the exposition of Amoris laetitia by Cardinal Schoenborn given in April 2016 when the exhortation was made public.\nI have read the Cardinal's exposition in both Italian and English, and I only find mention of the help of the sacraments in certain cases.\nOnce again, Mr. Ferrara assumes this means access to Holy Communion without prior sacramental confession.\nWith regard to the letter thanking the Bishops of Malta, it should be noted that Edward Pentin mentions a letter of Cardinal Baldiserri not a letter of Pope Francis.\nMoreover, this letter has not been made public so we don't know exactly what it says other than an expression of thanks.\nThis seems to be very thin evidence for claiming Pope Francis wishes the bishops to admit public adulterers to the sacraments while continuing in their adulterous relations.\nAs a lawyer, Ferrara should have a better sense of what really counts as evidence.\nAs a Christian, he should also be mindful of the command against bearing false witness.\nBeyond these considerations, I wish to express a personal concern I have about Mr. Ferrara's standing in the Catholic Church.\nHe says that Dr. Goldstein and I are \u201cfoot soldiers of a Leviathan Church\u201d because we defend the Roman Pontiff.\nDoes Mr. Ferrara believe that the Catholic Church under Pope Francis is a \u201cLeviathan Church\u201d and not the Catholic Church?\nIf this is so, then it would suggest that Mr. Ferrara is refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff and communion with the members of the Church subject to him.\nThis, though, is the very definition of schism found in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2089 and the 1983 CIC canon 751.\nI hope Mr. Ferrara can clarify what he means by the \u201cLeviathan Church\u201d under Pope Francis.\nA more simple question to him would be this: \u201cAre you refusing submission to the Roman Pontiff or communion with the members subject to him?\u201d\nI apologize ahead of time if I misconstrued his words.\nI believe, though, my question is reasonable in light of his reference to a \u201cLeviathan Church\u201d distinct from \u201cthe dictates of the Immortal God in heaven.\u201d\nChris Ferrara to Robert Fastiggi \u2022 9 hours ago\nIf Dr. Fastiggi wishes to continue to pretend, despite a growing mountain of evidence, that Pope Francis has not in fact approved of the admission of public adulterers to Holy Communion--just as he did when Archbishop of Buenos Aires, and just as he did with the woman he telephoned in Argentina\u2014then I cannot help him.\nAs for my metaphorical reference to a \u201cLeviathan Church,\u201d I am afraid Dr. Fastiggi has succumbed to an unfortunate

allegedly shot stopping the massacre in Las Vegas over a week ago is not listed or registered as such.\nJesus Campos, who the narrative is constantly changing around, is still a source of mystery.\nSo who is Jesus Campos?\nThat burning question has bothered many since the release of his name, but there\u2019s been no photograph of this alleged hero, even though we\u2019ve already seen crime scene images of the guns Stephen Paddock allegedly dragged up to his 32nd-floor hotel room.\nThe ever-changing narrative now though, seems to swirl around this unknown mystery security guard.\nAt first, Campos, a guard at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, was hailed a hero for helping guide police to gunman Stephen Paddock\u2019s room on the 32nd floor.\nPolice said Campos was shot in the leg at the end of Paddock\u2019s assault on concertgoers\u2014potentially distracting the gunman and causing him to panic and kill himself.\nBut now, questions have been raised after Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo revised the timeline and said Campos had actually been shot about 9:59 p.m. a (full six minutes before the mass shooting began at 10:05 p.m.) which means the guard could have instead led Paddock to start opening fire on the crowd for fear of being caught.\nPolice have said it was difficult to identify the source of the bullets during the attack, and the confusion added more minutes to their lengthy response.\nBut the revised timeline shows officers would have known where Paddock was before the mass shooting even started.\nDid Campos call 911?\nWhat happened during those six minutes?\nMuch of Campos\u2019s story and background remains a mystery.\n\u2013Newsweek\nCampos\u2019s co-worker Liliana Rodriguez started a GoFundMe account for him on October 3, explaining that he\u2019d been shot while on \u201crandom patrol\u201d and it could have been anyone of us.\n\u201cFunds will be used to provide relief and financial support for him while he gets back on his feet,\u201d Rodriguez\u2019s online petition says.\n\u201cThis is a young man that I work with day in and day out.\nAny financial support would be appreciated for the time he would need to recover.\u201d\nStrangely, a picture of Campos wasn\u2019t displayed as part of the fund because Rodriguez indicated that \u201cdue to privacy from the media we do not feel comfortable publishing a photo.\u201d\nThere are obviously certain things that the FBI and other investigators seem intent on covering up.\nTheir own narrative is quickly shattering.\nLas Vegas Metro Police Undersheriff Kevin McMahill explained more about Campos\u2019s actions the night of the shooting, helping fill in some of what happened ahead of the attack, but unfortunately, it only added more questions and gave little in the way of answers.\nMcMahill told KNPR, a local NPR affiliate, that Campos went up to the 32nd floor to investigate a door alarm.\nWhile on the 32nd floor, he found that a stairwell door was jammed and radioed down to maintenance.\nCampos heard a drilling sound and thought it was odd.\nA maintenance worker came up to the 32nd floor.\nAs the pair started talking, Paddock began firing through the door of his room, first with a single-fire gun and then with a rapid-fire rifle.\nPolice have said that when Campos radioed what happened, it helped them track where Paddock was holed up \u2013 so why change the narrative to make it even more unbelievable?\nAnd still, none of this explains why Campos is not registered as a security guard either, and why the timeline is being changed publically.\nWhat exactly do they want us to believe?\nArticle posted with permission from SHTFPlan\n", ["Doubt"]], ["Eyewitness Confessional: There Was An Active Shooter Targeting The Bellagio Hotel During The Las Vegas Massacre\nIn yet another astonishing eyewitness report that contradicts the official story surrounding the worst mass shooting in American history, a married couple who were celebrating their 10th anniversary in Las Vegas at the time of the shooting have come forward to reveal that there was an active shooter inside the Bellagio Hotel around the same time that supposed lone gunman Stephen Paddock was found dead.\nDuring the confessional, a Canadian man by the name of Jeff detailed the fact that he and his wife were in the Bellagio Resort and Casino around 11:20pm on the night of the shooting when panic broke out in the hotels lobby.\nJeff begins the interview by making clear his belief that there were multiple active shooters targeting different places in Las Vegas on the night of the attack.\n\u201cFirst of all, I think what needs to be said is that, from my perspective, there were multiple events that occurred around Las Vegas, up and down the Strip that night.\nIt wasn\u2019t just centralized around the Mandalay Hotel,\u201d the witness claimed.\nThe eyewitness then goes on to directly say that he and his wife were involved in an active shooter situation at a different hotel that authorities have so far done everything in their power to cover-up.\n\u201cMy wife and I were in Las Vegas celebrating our 10th anniversary and on October 1st we were involved in an incident with an active shooter at the Bellagio.\nThere is no mistake in my mind about it,\u201d he continued.\nJeff then describes a scene in which he and his wife were walking through the main lobby when screams and gunfire erupted.\nKeep in mind, this is all information that the police and the FBI has hidden from the American people.\n\u201cAll of a sudden there was just a crescendo of screams that started behind us in the lobby,\u201d he claimed.\n\u201cThen I heard somebody yell \u2018there\u2019s a shooter!\nThere\u2019s a shooter!\u2019 And then I heard like five or six pops, like unmistakable gunfire, unmistakably.\u201d\n\u201cThat was about 11:20 when we heard the shots and the screams\u2026 at that point you could hear and see the screams and see hundreds of people coming towards us.\u201d\nAmazingly, as Shepard Ambellas noted, \u201cThe man\u2019s claims match up to actual events captured in police audio recordings from the night of the shooting which confirms that between 11:15 and 11:18 p.m. on the night of Oct. 1 there was, in fact, something going on at the Bellagio.\u201d\nThis testimony also backs up claims by another eyewitness, Rene Downs, who has spent the past few days doing interviews about a shooter inside the Bellagio Hotel.\nSlowly but surely we are starting to see the official narrative regarding the Las Vegas Massacre be completely destroyed.\nAt this point it is strikingly obvious that authorities have lied to the American people about the worst mass shooting in our countries history.\nOne can only speculate as to what the reasons for these lies actually are?\n", ["Repetition", "Thought-terminating_Cliches", "Doubt", "Loaded_Language", "Flag-Waving"]], ["Two DREAMERs Caught Smuggling Illegal Aliens\nOr rather,

Jacobson explains the latest \u201crevise\u201d by the authorities is the now infamously botched Vegas investigation:\nOctober 13, 2017, Legal Insurrection\nPolice and hotel still don\u2019t agree on some details.\nI realize that in the heat of a shooting, particularly a mass shooting, it may take some time for a precise timeline to develop.\nBut it didn\u2019t take very long for the Las Vegas police to release a precise timeline.\nThe initial timeline was that Stephen Paddock\u2019s shooting stopped when, approximately 6 minutes after he started, he was interrupted by a security guard from the Mandalay Bay hotel.\nPaddock then turned his fire into the hallway, firing some 200 bullets, and after that the shooting stopped as police arrived.\nThat was Version No.\n1.\nSome days later, the Las Vegas police backed away from that timeline, and stated that the security guard actually arrived 6 minutes before Paddock started shooting into the crowd 32 stories below him.\nThat raised a number of question, including why no one called 911 after what must have been a loud volley of shots in a hotel hallway.\nThat was Version No.\n2.\nBut now that is disputed, in Version No.\n3.\nWaPo reports:\nLas Vegas police said Friday that the gunman who opened fire on a country music festival far below his hotel suite did not shoot a security guard six minutes before that rampage, contradicting a timeline they had offered earlier this week\u2026.\nThe confusion began Monday when police said that the gunman fired at the hotel security guard, Jesus Campos, six minutes before the mass shooting began, not during the massacre as they had said.\nLombardo also said police had hunted for the source of the gunfire and that officers responding to the gunman\u2019s floor were unaware that a guard was shot until they arrived there, at which point the shooting rampage had ended.\nMGM Resorts pushed back on this account, first saying Tuesday that there were unspecified inaccuracies and then, on Thursday, releasing a statement directly contradicting parts of what the police had said\u2026.\nLombardo had said Monday that Campos, the guard, was shot at 9:59 p.m. and that the mass shooting began at 10:05 p.m.\nThis six-minute gap relayed by Lombardo left uncertain whether there was any lag in alerting police to the source of the gunfire during critical moments.\nPolice said officers arrived on the 32nd floor at 10:17 p.m., two minutes after Paddock had stopped firing.\nMGM, though, said it was \u201cconfident\u201d that the 9:59 p.m. time was inaccurate and \u201cwas derived from a Mandalay Bay report manually created after the fact without the benefit of information we now have.\u201d The company also disputed the suggestion of a lag, saying the shooting rampage began within a minute of Campos reporting his injury on the 32nd floor.\nOn Friday, Lombardo effectively agreed with the company\u2019s statement, though he argued that the 9:59 p.m. time he had offered four days earlier \u201cwasn\u2019t inaccurate when I provided it.\u201d Lombardo said he was told this time had been written by someone in a security log.\nUpon investigation, Lombardo said, police learned that Campos first encountered a barricaded door on the 32nd floor at 9:59 p.m.\nThe guard was eventually fired upon by Paddock \u201cin close proximity to\u201d 10:05 p.m., when the mass shooting began, Lombardo continued.\nClear, right?\nNot so fast, the police and hotel still have disagreement over important details, such as when police arrived relative to Paddock\u2019s shooting at the crowd: An enormous, important discrepancy has emerged over what happened during the Las Vegas massacre: When did police arrive on the 32nd floor where Stephen Paddock was firing his deadly fusillade onto concertgoers below?\nLas Vegas police say they didn\u2019t get to the floor until after the shooting was over.\nBut MGM Resorts International, the owner of Mandalay Bay, says police officers were there shortly after the shooting began, responding to a report of a security guard being shot.\nThe discrepancy could raise questions about whether police might have taken steps to intervene while Paddock was launching his devastating 10-minute onslaught\u2026.\n\u2026 on Thursday, in response to inquiries about when Mandalay Bay notified police of the Campos shooting, MGM Resorts issued a statement that was unequivocal: Las Vegas police officers accompanied Mandalay Bay security to the Campos shooting and \u201cimmediately responded.\u201d MGM said that \u201cMetro officers were together with armed Mandalay Bay security officers in the building when Campos first reported that shots were fired over the radio.\nThese Metro officers and armed Mandalay Bay security officers immediately responded to the 32nd floor.\u201d The statement says MGM believes Paddock began firing out the window of his room within 40 seconds of Campos reporting his shooting, and Lombardo said Friday, \u201cI agree with the statement.\u201d These discrepancies on basic facts are feeding conspiracy theories.\nAs to Paddock\u2019s motive, still nothing from the investigation.\nArticle

President Trump\u2019s decision not to recertify, and to possibly withdraw from, the disastrous nuclear deal with Iran that Kerry negotiated on behalf of his boss Barack Obama.\nPresident Trump insisted on significant improvements to the Joint Plan of Comprehensive Action (JCPOA), as the deal is formally known.\nThe JCPOA\u2019s fundamental flaws that President Trump wants fixed include Iran\u2019s ability to block unfettered international inspections, the wiggle room that Iran is exploiting to continue developing and testing ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, and the sunset clause on nuclear enrichment that would provide Iran a clear path to becoming a nuclear armed state after the current restrictions are lifted.\nObama and Kerry had promised that these issues would be dealt with satisfactorily before agreeing to the final terms of the JCPOA.\nInstead they caved to Iranian pressure in order to get the deal done.\nNow that President Trump is trying to clean up the mess Obama and Kerry left him, Kerry has the gall to label President Trump\u2019s decision a \"reckless abandonment of facts in favor of ego and ideology\" and to accuse the Trump administration of \u201clying to the American people.\u201d It was the Obama administration that recklessly abandoned the facts in pressing ahead with the deal.\nThe Obama administration lied to the American people, abandoning its own promises to ensure that the deal contained ironclad protections.\nMoreover, all that President Trump has done so far is to return the JCPOA to Congress for review.\nHad Obama followed the Constitution and submitted the JCPOA to the Senate as a treaty in the first place, the JCPOA in its present form almost certainly would not have been approved.\nCongress should now have the opportunity to revisit the JCPOA to determine whether the protections that the Obama administration promised are working as advertised.\nCongress should also consider whether time limits on Iran\u2019s commitments continue to make sense in light of what we are now experiencing with Iran\u2019s nuclear technology collaborator, North Korea.\nIt bought time to turn into a full-fledged nuclear power under our noses.\nKerry had promised that the Iranian regime would be prohibited from testing ballistic missiles.\nThis turned out to be a lie.\nAfter the JCPOA was finalized, with no such prohibition included, Iran continued to test such missiles.\nThe Obama administration\u2019s response was that the missiles had become a separate issue, to be dealt with under a new United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing the JCPOA.\nThe new resolution replaced clear prohibitions imposed on Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program with a weak declaration in an annex that simply \u201ccalls upon\u201d Iran not to undertake any activity such as development and test launches related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons for eight years.\nIran has tested several ballistic missiles during the last two years, including two Qadr H missiles with the phrase \u201cIsrael must be wiped out\u201d emblazoned on the sides.\nThe commander of Iran\u2019s Army, Major General Ataollah Salehi, had told reporters just a month before the launch of those missiles that Iran was \"neither paying any attention to the resolutions against Iran, nor implementing them.\nThis is not a breach of the JCPOA.\u201d\nRussian Ambassador to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin, spurning requests from Obama administration officials to impose sanctions against Iran under the Security Council resolution, asserted that the Iranian missile test did not violate the resolution.\n\u201cA call is different from a ban so legally you cannot violate a call, you can comply with a call or you can ignore the call, but you cannot violate a call,\u201d the Russian ambassador said.\nIn short, the JCPOA did not cover the missile tests and the replacement UN Security Council resolution that did mention the missiles is toothless.\nDeputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes told CNN, during an interview aired on April 6, 2015, that under the deal\u2019s terms then still being negotiated, \u201cyou will have anywhere, anytime, 24/7 access as it relates to the nuclear facilities that Iran has.\"\nRhodes claimed that \u201cif we see a site that we need to inspect on a military facility, we can get access to that site and inspect it.\nSo if it's a suspicious site that we believe is related to its nuclear efforts, we can get access and inspect that site through the IAEA.\u201d This was another lie.\nAfter the JCPOA was finalized in July 2015, Rhodes shamelessly denied that anytime, anywhere inspections were ever considered as part of the negotiations.\n\u201cWe never sought in this negotiation the capacity for so-called anytime, anywhere,\u201d Rhodes said on July 14, 2015.\nThe JCPOA\u2019s supporters, including Kerry, have made much of the fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has on several occasions verified Iran\u2019s compliance with its commitments under the JCPOA, keeping its stock of low-enriched uranium below the limit set forth in the JCPOA and not pursuing further construction of the Arak reactor.\nIran was found to have slightly exceeded the limit on its stock of heavy water, but has remedied the problem to the IAEA\u2019s satisfaction.\nIAEA chief Yukiya Amano reiterated in a statement he issued on October 9th that Iran has remained in compliance with its JCPOA commitments.\nThe problem, as any clear-eyed observer of the process recognizes, is that the IAEA relies on Iran for self-inspection of certain sites that the regime does not want the IAEA to inspect freely on its own.\nIAEA inspectors have avoided examining military sites it knows exists and has no reliable way of tracking undeclared sites.\nThe IAEA\u2019s explanation for not visiting any of Iran\u2019s known military sites is that it had \u201cno reason to ask\u201d for access.\nEvidently, the IAEA is supposed to block out the fact that Iran had conducted tests relevant to nuclear bomb detonations at a military site before the JCPOA\u2019s finalization in 2015.\nThe IAEA should just pretend that such tests could not possibly happen again.\n\u201cNobody is allowed to visit Iran's military sites,\u201d said Iran\u2019s Head of Strategic Research Center at the Expediency Council and adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, Ali Akbar Velayati.\nIntimidation works.\nThe IAEA knows not to ask.\nAs to the JCPOA\u2019s sunset provisions, the Obama administration lied about that too.\nKerry claimed on September 2, 2015 that the JCPOA \u201cnever sunsets.\nThere\u2019s no sunset in this agreement.\u201d\nThis month Kerry has resorted to parsing words.\nHe claims the phrase 'sunset provisions' is a \u201cmisnomer,\u201d before then defending the JCPOA\u2019s time limits.\n\"We were comfortable because the cap on Iran\u2019s low-enriched uranium stockpile remains in place until 2030,\u201d Kerry wrote in an article published in the Washington Post late last month.\nIn other words, let\u2019s just kick the can down the road and hope for a more reasonable Iranian regime in 13 years that would agree to extend the time limits.\nIn the meantime, Kerry advises us not to worry.\nKerry declared, \u201c15 or 25 years from now, we still have the same military options we have today.\u201d\nJohn Kerry has obviously learned nothing from the North Korean fiasco, which resulted from years of phony agreements with the rogue regime and so-called \u201cstrategic patience.\u201d The United States clearly does not have the same military options today to deal with a nuclear armed North Korea as it did 23 years ago when former President Bill Clinton decided not to use military force to stamp out North Korea\u2019s nuclear program at its inception.\nInstead, Clinton started us down the primrose path of na\u00efve diplomacy with a duplicitous regime that now is on the verge of being able to strike the U.S. mainland with nuclear warheads delivered by intercontinental ballistic missiles.\nIt is precisely because North Korea\u2019s actions over the last 23 years have proven that making concessions to a rogue regime in order to obtain denuclearization commitments is so dangerous that President Trump does not want to make the same mistake with Iran.\nAmerica\u2019s European allies are also upset with President Trump for refusing to recertify the deal and threatening to pull out if certain conditions are not met.\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a joint statement last Friday praising the JCPOA and its implementation.\nThey said that the nuclear deal with Iran was \u201cthe culmination of 13 years of diplomacy and was a major step towards ensuring that Iran\u2019s nuclear programme is not diverted for military purposes.\nTherefore, we encourage the US Administration and Congress to consider the implications to the security of the US and its allies before taking any steps that might undermine the JCPOA, such as re-imposing sanctions on Iran lifted under the agreement.\u201d\nPerhaps these European leaders should remember their own history.\nAppeasement through phony deals with a rogue dictatorship does not work, as proven by the infamous Munich Pact signed by British and French Prime Ministers Neville Chamberlain and Edouard Daladier with German Chancellor Adolf Hitler seventy-nine years ago.\n", ["Repetition", "Appeal_to_fear-prejudice", "Loaded_Language", "Whataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring",

unprecedented rate.\nWith the ease of spreading the plague, the likelihood that this disease will move to other more densely populated regions of the planet has become a huge concern for many.\nSo far, the plague has claimed 57 lives and infected more than 680 others.\nThese figures are from October 12, however, and the disease is spreading rapidly.\nAn estimated 329 of these cases and 25 of the deaths were in the capital city of Antananarivo.\nOf the 684 cases reported as of October 12, 474 were the pneumonic plague, 156 bubonic and 1 septicemic plague.\nA further 54 were unspecified, according to the World Health Organization.\nOf Madagascar\u2019s 114 districts, 35 have reported cases of plague, including at least 10 cities.\nPlague is caused by infection with the bacterium Yersinia pestis and is typically spread through the bite of infected fleas, frequently carried by rats.\nThe bacteria will eventually end up causing the often fatal plague.\nSymptoms can include painful, swollen lymph nodes, called buboes, as well as fever, chills, and coughing.\nPneumonic plague is more virulent or damaging and is an advanced form of the disease characterized by a severe lung infection.\nThe infection can be transmitted from person to person via airborne droplets from coughing or sneezing.\nThe incubation period is extremely short too, and an infected person may die within 12 to 24 hours of contracting the bacteria making cures in underdeveloped regions of the globe difficult at best.\nAccording to CNN, the cases were reported by both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Bureau for Risk and Disaster Management (BNGRC) in Madagascar.\nThey include probable and suspected cases as well those that have been confirmed by laboratory tests.\nAnd while the country experiences regular outbreaks, with an estimated 400 cases of plague each year, this time things are very different, experts warn.\nThis year, health officials report the infections started much earlier than usual, and they\u2019re occurring in new areas, including urban settings.\nThey\u2019ve also seen an unexpected number of cases of pneumonic plague, which transmits more easily from person to person.\nHistorically dubbed the \u201cblack death\u201d the bubonic plague has been responsible for several worldwide pandemics in the past.\nEarly detection of the plague is key since both forms of it can be cured with antibiotics.\nBut, occasionally there can be cases of septicemic plague, where the infection has spread to a person\u2019s bloodstream and can cause bleeding and necrosis of tissue, turning it black.\nInternationally, this outbreak is also being taken seriously.\nWHO delivered more than 1.2 million doses of antibiotics and released $1.5

Thin Air\nBy now, we have all heard of Jesus Campos.\nHe\u2019s the heroic security guard that allegedly located the Las Vegas shooter, Steven Paddock.\nBut the narrative surrounding him has changed wildly since the authorities mentioned him, and now, he\u2019s mysteriously vanished into thin air.\nOf course, this leads many to believe that Campos didn\u2019t even exist, to begin with.\nHis mere existence appears to have been fabricated by the very authorities who are cramming lies down our throats about this massacre for the sake of political agendas.\nThere are two conflicting timelines of Campos\u2019s injury, but what the media has so far made clear, is that they want the public to believe Campos was walking down the Mandalay Bay Hotel & Casino\u2019s 32nd floor hallway, when Stephen Paddock spotted him on a camera he\u2019d allegedly set up in a room service cart, just outside his suite.\nOnce he saw Campos, Paddock reportedly fired nearly 200 rounds through his suite door, wounding Campos in the leg.\nMoments later (6 minutes actually, according to the newly revised timeline regarding Campos) Paddock allegedly opened fire on a crowd killing more than 50 and injuring nearly 500.\nBut Campos has been a mysterious subject since being wounded in the first moments of Paddock\u2019s assault.\nAfter speaking to hotel and law enforcement officials, Campos was scheduled to appear on local Las Vegas television for an interview but went missing just moments before he was supposed to be on the air.\nDavid Hickey, a spokesman for the Security, Police, and Fire Professionals of America (SPFPA), Campos\u2019s union, said he got a text that Campos had been taken to an urgent care facility, UMC Quick Care.\nBut UMC Quick Care says none of their clinics filled out an intake request for a patient by that name, and Campos has been silent since the text; vanishing into thin air.\nHe also isn\u2019t listed on the registry that shows the names of licensed security guards in Nevada.\n\u201cRight now I\u2019m just concerned where my member is, and what his condition is.\nIt\u2019s highly unusual,\u201d Hickey told media.\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping everything is OK with him and I\u2019m sure MGM or the union will let (media) know when we hear something,\u201d he said.\nIn the meantime, authorities still have not released a conclusive timeline for the shooting they desperately want us to believe was committed by Paddock.\nAnd, according to the latest reports, are still looking for a motive for the shooting.\n", ["Repetition", "Loaded_Language", "Doubt"]], ["THE OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS OF TRUMP'S IRAN INITIATIVE\nOriginally published the Jerusalem Post.\nOn Friday, US President Donald Trump initiated an important change in US policy toward Iran.\nNo, in his speech decertifying Iran\u2019s compliance with the nuclear accord it struck with his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump didn\u2019t announce a new strategy for preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, or stemming its hegemonic rise in the Middle East, or limiting its ability to sponsor terrorism.\nTrump\u2019s move was not operational.\nIt was directional.\nIn his address Friday, Trump changed the policy dynamics that dictate US policy on Iran.\nFor the first time since 2009, when Obama backed the murderous regime in Tehran, spurning the millions of Iranians who rose up in the Green Revolution, Trump opened up the possibility that the US may begin to base its policies toward Iran on reality.\nTrump began his remarks by setting out Iran\u2019s long rap sheet of aggression against America.\nStarting with the US embassy seizure and hostage crisis, Trump described Iran\u2019s crimes and acts of war against America in greater detail than any of his predecessors ever did.\nTrump\u2019s dossier was interlaced with condemnations of the regime\u2019s repression of its own people.\nBy merging Iran\u2019s external aggression with its internal repression, Trump signaled a readiness to drive a wedge \u2013 or expand the wedge \u2013 between the authoritarian theocrats that rule Iran and the largely secular, multiethnic and pro-Western people of Iran.\nTrump then turned his attention to Iran\u2019s illicit ballistic missile program, its sponsorship of terrorism, including its links to al-Qaida, its aggression against its neighbors, its aggressive acts against maritime traffic in the Straits of Hormuz, and its bids to destabilize and control large swaths of the Middle East through its proxies.\nIt is notable that these remarks preceded Trump\u2019s discussion of the nuclear deal \u2013 which was the ostensible subject of his speech.\nBefore Trump discussed Iran\u2019s breaches of the nuclear deal, he first demonstrated that contrary to the expressed views of his top advisers, it is impossible to limit a realistic discussion of the threat Iran constitutes to US national security and interests to whether or not and it what manner it is breaching the nuclear accord.\nThis was a critical point because for the past two years, US discourse on Iran has focused solely on whether or not Iran was complying with Obama\u2019s nuclear pact.\nBy placing the nuclear deal in the context of Iran\u2019s consistent, overarching hostility and aggression, Trump made it self-evident that no US interest is served in continuing to give Iran a free pass from congressional sanctions.\nAfter accomplishing that goal, Trump turned his attention to how Iran is actually breaching the letter and spirit of the nuclear pact.\nOnly then, almost as an afterthought, did he announce that he was decertifying Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal, setting the conditions for the renewal of congressional sanctions on Iran and opening the floodgates of congressional sanctions on Iran in retaliation for the full spectrum of its aggressive and illicit acts against the US, its interests and allies.\nBy empowering Congress to prohibit economic cooperation with Iran, Trump put the Europeans, Chinese and Russians on notice that they may soon face a choice between conducting business with the US and conducting business with Iran.\nAfter putting them on notice, Trump discussed the possibility of improving Obama\u2019s nuclear accord.\nAmong other things, he suggested expanding the inspection regime against Iran\u2019s nuclear installations and canceling the so-called \u201csunset\u201d clause that places an end date on the restrictions governing certain components of Iran\u2019s nuclear advancement.\nTrump\u2019s address has the potential to serve as the foundation of a major, positive shift in US policy toward Iran.\nSuch a shift could potentially facilitate the achievement of Trump\u2019s goals of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, containing its regional aggression and empowerment and defeating its terrorist proxies.\nUnfortunately, it is also likely, indeed, it is more likely, that his words will not be translated into policies to achieve these critical aims.\nTrump\u2019s decision to transfer immediate responsibility to Congress for holding Iran accountable for its hostile actions on the military and other fronts is a risky move.\nHe has a lot of enemies, and the nuclear deal has a lot of supporters on Capitol Hill.\nObama would have never been able to implement his nuclear deal if Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, hadn\u2019t agreed to cast the Constitution aside and ignore Obama\u2019s constitutional duty to present the nuclear deal to the Senate for ratification as a treaty.\nOver the past week, Trump and Corker have been involved in an ugly public fight precipitated by Corker\u2019s announcement that he will not be seeking reelection next year.\nToday Corker has nothing to restrain him from scuttling Trump\u2019s agenda.\nIf he wishes, out of spite, Corker can block effective sanctions from being passed.\nAnd he may do so even though the implications for his Senate colleagues would be dire and even though doing so would render him an unofficial protector of Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\nWhat is true for Corker is doubly true for the Democrats.\nLeading Democratic senators like Robert Menendez, Ben Cardin and Chuck Schumer, who opposed Obama\u2019s Iran deal may now feel that as opponents of the Trump administration, they are required to oppose any change to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act.\nIndeed, given the rise of radical forces in their party it is likely that they would rather give Iran a free pass for its anti-American aggression and nuclear proliferation than work with Republicans on Capitol Hill and in the White House.\nThen again, by framing the issue of Iran\u2019s threat to America as he did, and by transferring responsibility for reinstating sanctions and passing further sanctions on Iran to Congress, Trump opened up the possibility that Congress will conduct substantive \u2013 rather than personal \u2013 debates on Iran.\nAnd the more substantive those debates become, the further away the US discourse will move from the mendacious assumptions of Obama\u2019s Iran policy \u2013 that the Iranian regime is a responsible actor and potential US ally, and that there is nothing inherently aggressive or problematic about Iran\u2019s illicit nuclear weapons program.\nThe second major risk inherent in Trump\u2019s approach is that he will get his way; that the Europeans, Russians and Chinese and the Iranians will agree to improve the nuclear deal.\nThe problem here is not obvious.\nClearly, it is better if the deal is amended to delete the sunset clauses and expand the inspections regime.\nYet even an amended, improved deal will still serve as a shield to Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\nAn improved deal won\u2019t destroy Iran\u2019s centrifuges.\nIt won\u2019t take away Iran\u2019s enriched uranium.\nIt won\u2019t destroy Iran\u2019s nuclear installations.\nAnd it won\u2019t bring down the regime which by its nature ensures all of these things will remain a menace to the US, its allies and international security as a whole.\nSo long as the US continues to maintain a policy based on the false view that all that is necessary to destroy the threat of a nuclear armed Iran is a combination of the nuclear deal and economic sanctions, it will continue to ensure that Iran and its nuclear program remain a major threat.\nDistressingly, US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, the most outspoken supporter of decertifying Iranian compliance in the Trump administration, told NBC on Sunday that the US intends to remain in the nuclear deal.\nTo understand what must be done we must return to Trump\u2019s speech and its strategic significance.\nBy taking a holistic view of the Iranian threat \u2013 grounded in a recognition of the inherent hostility of the regime \u2013 Trump opened up the possibility that the US and its allies can develop a holistic policy for confronting and defeating Iran and its proxies.\nIf the Iran deal and sanctions are two components to a larger strategy rather than the entire strategy, they can be helpful.\nA wider strategy would target Iran\u2019s regional aggression by weakening its proxies and clients from Hezbollah and Hamas to the regimes in Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon.\nIt would target the regime itself by empowering the ayatollahs\u2019 domestic opponents.\nIt would pin down Iranian forces by arming and otherwise assisting the Iraqi Kurds to defend and maintain their control over their territory along the Iranian border while strengthening the ties between Iranian Kurds and Iraqi Kurds.\nFriday, Trump created the possibility for such a strategy.\nIt is up to members of Congress, and US allies like Israel and the Sunni Arab states to help Trump conceive and implement it.\nIf they fail, the possibility Trump created will be lost, perhaps irrevocably.\n", ["Repetition", "Doubt",

Foundation To Russian Bribery Case\nThis report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge\nWhile the mainstream media has largely ignored it, the scandal surrounding Russian efforts to acquire 20% of America\u2019s uranium reserves, a deal which was ultimately approved by the Obama administration, and more specifically the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) which included Hillary Clinton and Eric Holder, is becoming more problematic for Democrats by the hour.\nAs The Hill pointed out earlier this morning, the latest development in this sordid tale revolves around a man that the FBI used as an informant back in 2009 and beyond to build a case against a Russian perpetrator who ultimately admitted to bribery, extortion and money laundering.\nThe informant, who is so far only known as \u201cConfidential Source 1,\u201d says that when he attempted to come forward last year with information that linked the Clinton Foundation directly to the scandal he was promptly silenced by the FBI and the Obama administration.\nWorking as a confidential witness, the businessman made kickback payments to the Russians with the approval of his FBI handlers and gathered other evidence, the records show.\nSources told The Hill the informant\u2019s work was crucial to the government\u2019s ability to crack a multimillion dollar racketeering scheme by Russian nuclear officials on U.S. soil that involved bribery, kickbacks, money laundering and extortion.\nIn the end, the main Russian executive sent to the U.S. to expand Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s nuclear business, an executive of an American trucking firm and a Russian financier from New Jersey pled guilty to various crimes in a case that started in 2009 and ended in late 2015.\nToensing added her client has had contact from multiple congressional committees seeking information about what he witnessed inside the Russian nuclear industry and has been unable to provide that information because of the NDA.\n\u201cHe can\u2019t disclose anything that he came upon in the course of his work,\u201d she said.\nThe information the client possesses includes specific allegations that Russian executives made to him about how they facilitated the Obama administration\u2019s 2010 approval of the Uranium One deal and sent millions of dollars in Russian nuclear funds to the U.S. to an entity assisting Bill Clinton\u2019s foundation.\nAt the time, Hillary Clinton was serving as secretary of State on the government panel that approved the deal, the lawyer said.\nIt has been previously reported that Bill Clinton accepted $500,000 in Russian speaking fees in 2010 and collected millions more in donations for his foundation from parties with a stake in the Uranium One deal, transactions that both the Clintons and the Obama administration denied had any influence on the approval.\nIn the midst of the new discoveries revealed yesterday about the Uranium One case (see: FBI Uncovered Russian Bribery Plot Before Obama Approved Uranium One Deal, Netting Clintons Millions), \u201cConfidential Source 1\u201d has once again hired an attorney, Victoria Toensing, a former Reagan Justice Department official and former chief counsel of the Senate Intelligence Committee, to get his story out.\nSitting down with The Hill earlier, Toensing said that the last time her client tried to speak out \u201cboth his reputation and liberty\u201d were \u201cthreatened\u201d by the Obama administration in a effort to force his silence.\n\u201cAll of the information about this corruption has not come out,\u201d she said in an interview Tuesday.\n\u201cAnd so my client, the same part of my client that made him go into the FBI in the first place, says, \u2018This is wrong.\nWhat should I do about it?\u2019\u201d\nToensing said she also possesses memos that recount how the Justice Department last year threatened her client when he attempted to file a lawsuit that could have drawn attention to the Russian corruption during the 2016 presidential race as well as helped him recover some of the money Russians stole from him through kickbacks during the FBI probe.\nThe undercover client witnessed \u201ca lot of bribery going on around the U.S.\u201d but was asked by the FBI to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) that prevents him from revealing what he knows to Congress, Toensing explained.\nWhen he tried to bring some of the allegations to light in the lawsuit last year, \u201cthe Obama Justice Department threatened him with loss of freedom.\nThey said they would bring a criminal case against him for violating an NDA,\u201d she added.\nEmails obtained by The Hill show that a civil attorney working with the former undercover witness described the pressure the Justice Department exerted to keep the client from disclosing to a federal court what he knew last summer.\n\u201cThe government was taking a very harsh position that threatened both your reputation and liberty,\u201d the civil lawyer wrote in one email.\nIn another, she added, \u201cAs you will recall the gov\u2019t made serious threats sufficient to cause you to withdraw your civil complaint.\u201d\nAs we pointed out last summer when Peter Schweizer first released his feature documentary Clinton Cash, the Uranium One deal at the center of this scandal is believed to have netted the Clintons and their Clinton Foundation millions of dollars in donations and \u2018speaking fees\u2019 from Uranium One shareholders and other Russian entities.\nRussian Purchase of US Uranium Assets in Return for $145mm in Contributions to the Clinton Foundation \u2013 Bill and Hillary Clinton assisted a Canadian financier, Frank Giustra, and his company, Uranium One, in the acquisition of uranium mining concessions in Kazakhstan and the United States.\nSubsequently, the Russian government sought to purchase Uranium One but required approval from the Obama administration given the strategic importance of the uranium assets.\nIn the run-up to the approval of the deal by the State Department, nine shareholders of Uranium One just happened to make $145mm in donations to the Clinton Foundation.\nMoreover, the New Yorker confirmed that Bill Clinton received $500,000 in speaking fees from a Russian investment bank, with ties to the Kremlin, around the same time.\nNeedless to say, the State Department approved the deal giving Russia ownership of 20% of U.S. uranium assets.\nMeanwhile, the \u2018journalists\u2019 over at CNN are still trying to get to the bottom of exactly who spent the $100,000 on Facebook ads\u2026\n", ["Repetition", "Loaded_Language"]], ["Iranian Aggression Intensifies\nLast July, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) military commander and chief of staff of Iran\u2019s armed forces, warned that \u201cputting the Revolutionary Guard in the terrorist lists with terrorist groups can be very costly to the United States and its military bases and forces in the region.\u201d IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said on October 8th that \"if the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.\"\nThe next day the Iranian regime warned of a \"crushing\" response if the United States were to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization.\nPresident Trump has called the Iranian regime\u2019s bluff with his announcement last week that he would do just that.\nDesignating the IRGC as a terrorist organization and imposing new sanctions for its aggressive actions in the region is not a restoration of the sanctions lifted by the Obama administration as part of its disastrous nuclear deal with Iran.\nIf Iran insists it can do what it wants militarily in terms of missile launches, support of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas, and arms transfers without violating the nuclear deal, then the United States can certainly act to curb such activities through financial pressure.\nThe U.S. can impose sanctions against the Iranian regime\u2019s principal instrument for projecting aggressive, destabilizing force outside of its borders without violating the nuclear deal.\nThe Iranian regime does not see it that way, however.\nWith the lifting of the nuclear-related sanctions making available billions of dollars to Iran\u2019s leaders to further finance the IRGC\u2019s exploits in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere, the regime is furious that the Trump administration is tightening the financial screws again, even if for reasons not directly related to Iran\u2019s compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal.\nThus, it is threatening U.S. forces and bases in the region.\nA couple of seemingly unrelated events this past week point to Iran\u2019s positioning itself for more aggressive military actions that could place U.S. forces in harm\u2019s way.\nOn Tuesday, Major General Bagheri landed in Damascus for talks with Syrian President Bashar Assad and senior Syrian officials, including the defense minister and the chief of staff of the Syrian armed forces.\nBagheri is quoted as saying that his visit\u2019s purpose was to \u201cput a joint strategy on continuing co-ordination and co-operation at the military level.\u201d Some experts on Iran believe that Bagheri\u2019s visit to Damascus at this time is intended to reinforce a message that Iran will continue to supply weaponry to Syria and to reinforce the presence of its terrorist proxy Hezbollah in Syria.\nThis will not only serve to bolster the Assad regime, but it also will strengthen Iran's ability to follow through on its threats to the U.S. and its allies, principally Israel.\nMeanwhile, following the departure of the Kurds from Kirkuk, Iraq earlier this week, the IRGC\u2019s operational Al Qods arm reportedly established a command center and five bases there.\nAccording to Debkafile, this constitutes \u201cthe first military facility Iran has ever established openly in Iraq.\u201d The Kirkuk region holds 45 percent of Iraqi\u2019s oil.\nThe Iraqi branch of Iran\u2019s terrorist proxy Hezbollah has vowed that once ISIS is defeated it will start killing Americans, as it has done before.\nIt is against this backdrop that U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley used her entire speech to the UN Security Council on Wednesday to denounce the Iranian regime on multiple grounds.\nThe session was supposed to be devoted to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but Ambassador Haley departed from the monthly ritual during which Israel is normally singled out for criticism by other Council members.\nShe went after Iran instead.\nShe explained why the Trump administration decided to take \u201ca comprehensive approach to confronting the Iranian regime,\u201d which does not give the regime a get out of jail free card even if it is in technical compliance with the loophole-ridden nuclear deal agreed to by the Obama administration.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t talk about stability in the Middle East without talking about Iran,\u201d Ambassador Haley said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s because nearly every threat to peace and security in the Middle East is connected to Iran\u2019s outlaw behavior.\nThe United States has now embarked on a course that attempts to address all aspects of Iran\u2019s destructive conduct, not just one aspect.\nIt\u2019s critical that the international community do the same.\nJudging Iran by the narrow confines of the nuclear deal misses the true nature of the threat.\nIran must be judged in totality of its aggressive, destabilizing, and unlawful behavior.\nTo do otherwise would be foolish.\u201d\nAmbassador Haley accused the Iranian regime of continuing to \u201cplay\u201d the Security Council.\n\u201cIran hides behind its assertion of technical compliance with the nuclear deal while it brazenly violates the other limits on its behavior.\nAnd we have allowed them to get away with it.\nThis must stop.\u201d\nAmbassador Haley proceeded to list various violations by the Iranian regime of Security Council resolutions pertaining to the transfer of conventional weapons from Iran and the arming of terrorist groups, including the Houthi rebels in Yemen and Hezbollah.\nShe also pointed to what she called the Iranian regime\u2019s \u201cmost threatening act\u201d \u2013 its launch of ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons.\n\u201cWhen a rogue regime starts down the path of ballistic missiles, it tells us that we will soon have another North Korea on our hands,\u201d Ambassador Haley said.\n\u201cIf it is wrong for North Korea to do this, why doesn\u2019t that same mentality apply to Iran?\n\u201c\nAs for the Iran\u2019s supposed technical compliance with its commitments under the nuclear deal itself, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the UN\u2019s international inspectors are not able to visit Iran\u2019s military sites.\nPast work on nuclear explosive trigger devices appears to have taken place at one or more such sites in the past.\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Yukiya Amano admitted last month that when it comes to the IAEA\u2019s capacity to check whether Iran was conducting work on a nuclear explosive device, his agency\u2019s \u201ctools are limited.\u201d The Iranian regime has also attempted to skirt the restrictions in the JCPOA on its procurement of materials, equipment, goods and technology related to Iran\u2019s nuclear activities.\nThe Heritage Foundation noted in its recent report on the JCPOA, for example, that Iran was \u201ccaught red-handed trying to purchase nuclear technology and restricted ballistic missile technology from German companies.\u201d\nU.S. intelligence had discovered North Korea\u2019s transfer of missile parts to Iran at the very same time that Iran was negotiating the nuclear deal, in clear violation of UN Security Council resolutions then in effect.\nThe Obama administration chose to look the other way.\nDoes anybody with a modicum of sense really believe that such collaboration between the two rogue nations is not going on today?\nIran is flush with cash, thanks to the JCPOA.\nIt wants to build out its missile and nuclear enrichment capabilities.\nIn addition to covert transfers of materials and technology to Iran in violation of the nuclear deal, the JCPOA may provide a loophole for Iran to exploit in outsourcing some of the development work to North Korea for hard currency, which North Korea desperately needs.\nThey are a perfect match for each other.\nProponents of the JCPOA argue that exiting the nuclear deal unless it is changed to the Trump administration\u2019s satisfaction would undermine U.S. credibility with North Korea and thereby kill any chance of negotiations to resolve the crisis caused by North Korea's continued testing of sophisticated nuclear arms and ballistic missiles.\n\"If we want to talk to North Korea now, the possible end for the nuclear deal with Iran would jeopardize the credibility of such treaties,\" Reuters quoted German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel as saying.\nGermany is one of the parties to the JCPOA.\nOther European allies have voiced similar concerns.\nSo have Obama\u2019s former Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.\nThis argument is absurd on its face.\nThe whole point is to prevent Iran from becoming the next North Korea, not to kick the can down the road as usual.\nNorth Korea\u2019s aggressive pursuit of nuclear weapons and of intercontinental ballistic missiles equipped with nuclear warheads proves that weak agreements full of front-loaded goodies rewarding rogue regimes for elusive promises are worthless.\n", ["Repetition", "Thought-terminating_Cliches",

ISIS is coming to a close ... need to go home.\nAny foreign fighters in Iraq need to go home.\"\nTillerson meant Iran's Quds Force in Iraq should go home, and the Shiite militia in Iraq should be conscripted into the army.\nBut what if the Baghdad regime of Haider al-Abadi does not agree?\nWhat if the Quds Force does not go home to Iran and the Shiite militias that helped retake Kirkuk refuse to enlist in the Iraqi army?\nWho then enforces Tillerson's demands?\nConsider what is happening in Syria.\nThe U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, largely Kurdish, just annihilated ISIS in Raqqa and drove 60 miles to seize Syria's largest oil field, al-Omar, from ISIS.\nThe race is now on between the SDF and Bashar Assad's army to secure the border with Iraq.\nBottom line: The U.S. goal of crushing the ISIS caliphate is almost attained.\nBut if our victory in the war against ISIS leaves Iran in the catbird seat in Baghdad and Damascus, and its corridor from Tehran to Baghdad, Damascus and Beirut secure, is that really a victory?\nDo we accept that outcome, pack up and go home?\nOr do we leave our forces in Syria and Iraq and defy any demand from Assad to vacate his country?\nSunday's editorial in The Washington Post, \"The Next Mideast Wars,\" raises the crucial questions now before us.\nWould President Trump be willing to fight a new war to keep Iran from consolidating its position in Iraq and Syria?\nWould the American people support such a war with U.S. troops?\nWould Congress, apparently clueless to the presence of 800 U.S. troops in Niger, authorize a new U.S. war in Syria or Iraq?\nIf Trump and his generals felt our vital interests could not allow Syria and Iraq to drift into the orbit of Iran, where would we find allies for such a fight?\nIf we rely on the Kurds in Syria, we lose NATO ally Turkey, which regards Syria's Kurds as collaborators of the PKK in Turkey, which even the U.S. designates a terrorist organization.\nThe decision as to whether this country should engage in new post-ISIS wars in the Mideast, however, may be taken out of our hands.\nSaturday, Israel launched new air strikes against gun positions in Syria in retaliation for shells fired into the Golan Heights.\nDamascus claims that Israel's \"terrorist\" allies inside Syria fired the shells, to give the IDF an excuse to attack.\nWhy would Israel wish to provoke a war with Syria?\nBecause the Israelis see the outcome of the six-year Syrian civil war as a strategic disaster.\nHezbollah, stronger than ever, was part of Assad's victorious coalition.\nIran may have secured its land corridor from Tehran to Beirut.\nIts presence in Syria could now be permanent.\nAnd only one force in the region has the power to reverse the present outcome of Syria's civil war--the United States.\nBibi Netanyahu knows that if war with Syria breaks out, a clamor will arise in Congress to have the U.S. rush to Israel's aid.\n\"A failure by the United States to defend its allies or promote new political arrangements for (Syria and Iraq) will lead only to more war, the rise of new terrorist threats, and, ultimately, the necessity of more U.S.\nintervention.\"\nClosing its Sunday editorial the Post instructed the president:The interventionist Post is saying: The situation is intolerable.\nConfront Assad and Iran now, or fight them later.\nTrump is being led to the Rubicon.\nIf he crosses, he joins Bush II in the history books.\nPatrick J.

decided not to block release of the CIA\u2019s remaining JFK-assassination related records except for those records that directly implicate the CIA in the assassination, which will continue to remain secret.\u201d\nOkay, he didn\u2019t really put it like that.\nBut that\u2019s the potential and likely import of his announcement, which actually read as follows:\nSubject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.\u201d (Italics added.)\nThe operative words, of course, are: \u201cSubject to the receipt of further information\u2026.\u201d\nWhat is going on here?\nNegotiations.\nThe art of the deal.\nThe CIA desperately does not want to show the American people its long-secret JFK-related records.\nIt has asked Trump to continue keeping at least some of them secret notwithstanding the passage of more than 50 years since the Kennedy assassination.\nUnder long-established custom and tradition in Washington, D.C., when someone asks someone else for a favor, the person who is in a position to grant the favor demands something in return.\nThat\u2019s where the negotiations between Trump and the CIA come into play.\nTrump wants something in return.\nWe don\u2019t know what \u2014 maybe laying off on the Russia investigation \u2014 but his announcement last Friday is obviously part of the concluding steps of such negotiations.\nTime to buy old US gold coins\nWhat Trump has done with his announcement is send a clear message to the CIA: \u201cGive me what I want and I\u2019ll give you want you want.\nOtherwise, I will let all your cherished long-secret records relating to the JFK assassination be shown to the American people.\u201d\nMake no mistake about it: A deal is about to be made.\nThe CIA will cave.\nIt will end up giving Trump whatever it is he wants.\nTrump is in the driver\u2019s seat because the CIA cannot afford to permit the American people to see the records it wants to continue to be kept secret.\nAnd once the CIA gives Trump what he wants, he will cave and give the CIA the continued secrecy it so desperately needs.\nAll this will happen by this Thursday, the date set by law for release of all the JFK records that Trump has not blocked.\nThink about it: The CIA has asked the president to continue secrecy of records that are more than 50 years old or, apparently, some relating to secret correspondence between the CIA and the Assassination Records Review Board back in the 1990s.\nThe CIA\u2019s ground?\n\u201cNational security\u201d of course, the two most important and meaningless words in the American political lexicon.\nNational security?\nReally?\nWhatever definition that one might put on that nebulous term, no reasonable person can honestly believe that the release of 50-year-old records are going to result in the United States falling into the ocean or even that the communists are going to take over the federal government.\nThe CIA says that releasing its decades-old JFK records will reveal secret \u201cmethods\u201d of intelligence gathering.\nReally?\nWhat, like the CIA was using typewriters instead of computers and pay telephones instead of cell phones?\nWhat is amazing (or not) is the extreme nonchalance of the mainstream media to the CIA\u2019s request for continued secrecy.\nThat should be big news.\nIt\u2019s essentially an admission of guilt, given that it is absolutely ludicrous to think that \u201cnational security\u201d would be threatened by the release of the CIA\u2019s long-secret JFK-assassination-related records.\nYou see, the mainstream media starts with the assumption that the CIA had nothing to do with the assassination.\nIn their minds, the assassination was committed by a lone nut former U.S. Marine communist, one who had no motive to kill the president.\nSuch being the case, the mainstream media, deferring to the CIA, automatically concludes that its wish to continue keeping secret has to be based on \u201cnational security\u201d grounds rather than an attempt by the CIA to continue its cover-up of its assassination of the president.\nLet\u2019s proceed from the opposite assumption: That the CIA, in partnership with the military and the Mafia, orchestrated the assassination by framing a former U.S. Marine who was then working for U.S. intelligence, either Navy intelligence, the CIA, or the FBI, or a combination of all three.\nDon\u2019t forget, after all, that that\u2019s what Oswald said.\nHe said he was being framed.\nYet, from the very beginning, the mainstream media has never given any serious consideration to the possibility that Oswald was framed for the crime.\nInstead, they have steadfastly stuck with the official story, one that has all the characteristics of a pat frame-up: That Oswald acted alone or possibly acted in concert with others, both of which lead to nothing but dead ends, contradictions, and anomalies.\nNow, let\u2019s assume instead that Oswald was telling the truth when he said he was being framed.\nIn that case, it would be imperative that the CIA and the military keep as tight a lid on their records as possible to ensure that investigators or investigative reporters would have a difficult time piercing through to the circumstantial evidence that establishes the frame-up.\nAs part of the frame-up, the CIA would have to fortify the persona of Oswald, its intelligence agent, as a purported communist.\nThat would enable the CIA to blame the assassination on a communist, which, not coincidentally, was the advice that the Pentagon and the CIA were doling out to Latin American military dictatorships at the School of the Americas.\nIn cases of covert state-sponsored assassinations, Latin American regimes were taught, a good strategy was to blame the assassination on a communist because then they could smear anyone who challenged the official story as a communist sympathizer.\nIt would also explain why the CIA was closely monitoring Oswald\u2019s movements prior to the assassination, something else that the CIA kept secret for decades.\nThey had to make certain that Oswald was not on to them and had not discovered that he was being set up for a frame-up.\nThe first organization that came out with a press release advertising Oswald\u2019s bona fides was the DRE, an anti-communist group in New Orleans with which Oswald had had contact.\nWhat no one knew at the time, and what the CIA intentionally kept secret for decades, was that the DRE was a CIA front organization.\nIt was being generously funded by the CIA and controlled by a secret CIA agent named George Joannides, which the CIA would intentionally keep secret from the Warren Commission in the 1960s, the House Select Committee in the 1970s, and the Assassination Records Review Board in the 1990s.\nBut there was another big operation to establish Oswald\u2019s communist bona fides before the assassination.\nIt had to do with Oswald\u2019s trip to Mexico City, where he visited the Cuban and Soviet embassies.\nSomething dreadful obviously went wrong with that part of the operation because the official investigation into it was quickly shut down during the early post-assassination period.\nToday, Oswald\u2019s Mexico City trip, which is part of those CIA records ready to be released, is still shrouded in mystery.\nThe CIA\u2019s continued secrecy in the JFK assassination is no big surprise.\nAs I wrote in my October 11 article, \u201cWill Trump Make a Deal with the CIA on JFK Records?,\u201d the CIA is between a rock and a hard place.\nOn the one hand, it knows that those records will further implicate the CIA in the Kennedy assassination.\nOn the other hand, it knows that by seeking continued secrecy, it\u2019s essentially an implicit acknowledgment of guilt.\nNot surprisingly, it is choosing the latter course, especially because it knows that its assets and allies in the mainstream press will continue to come to its defense with respect to its ridiculous claim of \u201cnational security.\u201d\nDo the CIA\u2019s long-secret records contain a video-taped confession?\nOf course not.\nAnd they don\u2019t contain any reference to assassinating Kennedy.\nThe CIA\u2019s practice from the very beginning has been to not put any reference to a state-sponsored assassination into writing.\nBut there has to be a reason why the CIA chose to keep this particular batch of records secret for more than 50 years.\nThose long-secret records undoubtedly include small bits of important circumstantial evidence that fill out even further the mosaic of a regime-change operation that took place in Dallas in November 1963, the same types of regime-change operation that took place in Iran in 1953, Guatemala in 1954, Cuba in 1960-1963, Congo in 1961, and Chile in 1973, all of which the CIA steadfastly kept secret from the American people.\nIn 1953, the CIA was in the process of developing a top-secret manual on assassinations, one that showed that the CIA was specializing not only in the art of assassination but also in the art of covering up its role in state-sponsored assassinations.\nEvery American owes it to himself to read that manual.\nToo bad the mainstream press has never given that manual the consideration it deserves.\nIf it did, it might not be so deferential to the deal that Trump and the CIA are about to make to continue the JFK assassination cover-up by continuing to keep some of the CIA\u2019s decades-old JFK\u2019s related assassination records secret from the American people.\nReprinted with permission from The Future of Freedom Foundation.\nThe Best of Jacob G.

doctors leaned over an operating table performing surgery lit only by a flashlight.\nAccording to Slate, the image quickly made the rounds on the internet; it currently has almost 9,000 retweets and

continue to provide aid to the post-apocalyptic ravaged territory.\n\u201cEven before Hurricanes Irma and Maria hit the U.S. territories, the islands\u2019 health care system was suffering from the ongoing economic crisis.\nThe islands are grappling with physician shortages, Medicaid programs facing an impending funding cliff, and widespread disparities in Federal health programs\u2014and that

Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), it will take months before power is fully restored.\nHospitals have been forced to prioritize patients, ration services, and forgo elective surgeries.\nThe power grid\u2019s failure has caused more problems than many anticipated, like the stall of relief efforts.\nWithout electricity, communications are non-existent too.\nSome 33 days after Hurricane Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico, only 23 percent of residents have electricity, according to Status.pr, which provides daily updates on basic services on the island.\nWhile there are still other problems as well, such as gas stations being slow to reopen, and roads getting badly damaged, the power grid\u2019s utter annihilation in the category 4 winds is not just a temporary inconvenience.\nThe different ways that the lack of electricity can set off a cascade of other crises is becoming increasingly clear.\nA giant government-owned hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, arrived in Puerto Rico weeks ago to help out, but many people don\u2019t know about the ship.\nWithout electricity, most cell phone towers are down.\nBut even if communications were working, residents can\u2019t get to the port, as many of the island\u2019s roads are impassable and most are without gasoline to power a car.\nThe ship has extensive space and equipment for trauma care and a large staff, but CNN reported

news report featuring a clip of Duke being interviewed at a white nationalist rally held in Charlottesville, Virginia this past August.\nAt this same rally, a white nationalist plowed his car into a group of people who were protesting the rally, killing one.\nThis was not the first time Zakkout has promoted David Duke.\nIndeed, he has done so for years.\nIn February 2016, Zakkout publicized on his Facebook page a bizarre Duke report, titled in part \u2018Dr.\nDavid Duke Exposes the Real Racist Jewish Supremacists Who Orchestrate the Destruction of European Mankind\u2026\u2019 Above the

disease.\nBut the oncoming rainy season could see the number of those infected explode exponentially.\nThe rainy season poses a threat to the containment of the plague because outbreaks of this magnitude often seem to be seasonal.\nThe Foreign Office recently warned that the deadly outbreak is entering its most dangerous phase.\nIts website said that \u201coutbreaks of plague tend to be seasonal and occur mainly during the rainy season.\u201d The African island\u2019s wet season officially began today and will last until the end of April, meaning the downward trend the plague had seen over the past few days, will likely turn upward again.\nBecause the disease can be spread easily through a cough or sneeze, experts are fearful.\nIt would take just one infected traveler who made it to Africa\u2019s mainland or even nearby British honeymoon paradises like Mauritius, the Maldives or the Seychelles to spread the disease globally.\nThe Seychelles is currently putting anyone traveling from Madagascar into quarantine on arrival as a precaution.\nThe outbreak has been fueled by performing the ancient practice of Famadihana.\nFamadihana is the \u201cdancing with the dead\u201d ritual which sees locals dig up deceased relatives and dance with them before they are reburied.\nJust contact with a corpse who\u2019s death was because they contracted the plague could sicken a person.\nThe country\u2019s health chief Willy Randriamarotia said: \u201cIf a person dies of pneumonic plague and is then interred in a tomb that is subsequently opened for a Famadihana, the bacteria can still be transmitted and contaminate whoever handles the body.\u201d The tradition has been banned since the outbreak began, but it is feared ceremonies have taken place regardless as local continue to balk that their rituals have contributed to the outbreak.\nThis latest warning that the rainy season could worsen the outbreak comes on the heels of the reports that British aid workers said the epidemic will get worse before it gets better.\nOlivier Le Guillou of Action Against Hunger said: \u201cThe epidemic is ahead of us, we have not yet reached the peak.\u201d\nAs many as 50 aid workers are believed to have been among the 1,200 people infected with the more dangerous airborne pneumonic strain of the disease.\n", ["Repetition", "Doubt", "Appeal_to_fear-prejudice",

Theological Commission Sacked for Questioning Pope of Mercy & Dialogue\nThe Catholic Twitterverse is alive today with criticism of the USCCB\u2019s decision to sack Fr.\nThomas Weinandy, the former head of their doctrinal office.\nIt took a matter of hours for the brave defenders of the status quo to leap into action against the mild Franciscan friar\u2019s polite plea to Pope Francis to defend the Catholic Faith and faithful.\nOr at least to stop attacking them.\nIn a letter made public November 1st, Fr.\nWeinandy, a former chief of staff for the U.S. Bishops\u2019 Committee on Doctrine and a member of the Vatican\u2019s International Theological Commission, warned Pope Francis that he has caused \u201cchronic confusion\u201d among the faithful and bishops.\nHe wrote to the pope, \u201cTo teach with such an intentional lack of clarity inevitably risks sinning against the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of truth.\u201d He added that Catholics are \u201cdisconcerted\u201d by the appointment of bishops \u201cwho seem not merely open to those who hold views counter to Christian belief, but who support and even defend them.\u201d\nIn an interview yesterday with John Allen\u2019s Crux, he added, more prophetically than he had perhaps intended, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can, or should, associate my letter with the USCCB or the American bishops.\nNeither was involved in my writing the letter, and its publication will be news to them.\u201d\n\u201cBishops are quick learners,\u201d he wrote in his letter, \u201cand what many have learned from your pontificate is not that you are open to criticism, but that you resent it,\u201d claiming that many bishops don\u2019t speak out publicly for fear they will be \u201cmarginalized or worse.\u201d\nAnd sure enough, within hours of making his letter public, we learned that Fr.\nWeinandy had been given the boot.\nOf course, the Twitterverse is busy commenting on the irony: how a man expressing grave concerns that there is an atmosphere of fear of being punished for expressing grave concerns, was immediately fired.\nPerhaps the most astonishing aspect of this little incident is just how completely blind the US bishops \u2013 as with nearly all the episcopate \u2013 are to what political analysts call the \u201coptics\u201d.\nPolitical consultants often ask: how does it look?\nAnd it looks extremely bad.\nAs though the fog of irony weren\u2019t thick enough, in response to the outrage from Catholics, the USCCB has done what all the other members of Pope Francis\u2019 cabal have done and started blocking critics from its Twitter account.\nWhich, it must be said, only proves Fr.\nWeinandy\u2019s point once again.\nSome of the criticism has been unusually sharp.\nFr.\nHunwicke wrote this afternoon, \u201cThis cheap and vulgar ritual humiliation exemplifies the extent to which P[ope] F[rancis] is presiding over a bully-boy Church in which midget bishops and minicardinals compete to defeat each other in the sycophancy stakes.\nJust as Tom Weinandy has, in effect, just said.\u201d\nAs I write this, the outrage is doing the opposite of dying down, and is surely a sign of how fed up Catholics \u2013 even those who would never identify themselves as Traditionalists \u2013 have become with this pope and his cadre of episcopal bullies.\nIn his letter, Fr.\nWeinandy made a point of stating that he is not signatory to the Filial Correction or any other public declaration against Pope Francis\u2019 agenda.\nIn fact, a former student of his wrote to me today saying,\n\u201cI see that Fr.\nThomas Weinandy has been squashed.\nHe was one of my professors in Patristics at Oxford and he was one of the most mild-mannered, least confrontational, kindest academics one could have hoped to meet.\nTo me, the fact that he has chosen to write to express his concern about the crisis in the church and the papacy is very significant.\nHe is neither a traditionalist, nor a controversialist, but a humble and straightforward Friar who is clear-thinking and entirely loyal to the Church and Her teaching.\nI would be surprised now if we were not see more of this sort of letter/exercise of conscience.\nI imagine that it\u2019s going to become harder and harder for men of conscience and position to sit on the fence.\u201d\nWhen I posted it, this assessment was backed up by Joseph Shaw, the head of the UK\u2019s Latin Mass Society and the spokesman for the Filial Correction, who wrote, \u201cThis is absolutely right.\nNot a man to seek out confrontation.\u201d\nThe Crux piece offered a succinct bullet point list of Fr.\nWeinandy\u2019s concerns.\nHe said the pope is\u2026\nFostering \u201cchronic confusion.\u201d\n\u201cDemeaning\u201d the importance of doctrine.\nAppointing bishops who \u201cscandalize\u201d believers with dubious \u201cteaching and pastoral practice.\u201d\nGiving prelates who object the impression they\u2019ll be \u201cmarginalized or worse\u201d if they speak out.\nCausing faithful Catholics to \u201close confidence in their supreme shepherd.\u201d\nOur friend Edward Pentin has reproduced the full text of the letter at the National Catholic Register which is definitely worth a read.\nFr.\nWeinandy sent the letter to the pope on July 31, the Feast of St. Ignatius of Loyola.\nLike the Dubia cardinals, he said he made it public only after the pope had ignored it for months.\nNotable in his critique is its distinct pastoral flavour, his concern on the effect the situation is having on ordinary people.\nThe pope, he said, seems \u201cto censor and even mock\u201d critics of Amoris Laetitia for their desire to interpret it in keeping with Catholic teaching, and in doing so is committing a \u201ckind of calumny\u2026alien to the nature of the Petrine ministry.\u201d\nIn an interview with Crux, Weinandy said he is not afraid of reprisals but \u201cmore concerned about the good that my letter might do.\u201d The letter \u201cexpresses the concerns of many more people than just me, ordinary people who\u2019ve come to me with their questions and apprehensions.\nI wanted them to know that I listened.\u201d\n\u201cI have done what I believe God wanted me to do,[1]\u201d he said.\nIn fact, Fr.\nWeinandy has bolstered my own \u201cGreat Clarifier\u201d theory, saying that this pontificate, and the lack of response to it from priests and bishops, is being allowed by God in order to reveal \u201cjust how weak is the faith of many within the Church,\u201d He added that Francis has revealed that many in the Church \u201chold harmful theological and pastoral views.\u201d\nWhich inevitably brings to mind other responses that have not been quite so clear, nor so pastoral.\nWhen Cardinal Muller was removed abruptly from his position as head of the CDF, the conservative Catholic world wailed that it was another case of a \u201cgood\u201d prelate being got rid of.\nAnd it seems clear from the way it was done, and the way Francis treated Muller in general, that he was indeed got rid of.\nBut his depiction by conservative writers as a beleaguered champion of Catholic orthodoxy persecuted by the regime for his faithfulness betrays a somewhat selective memory and short attention span.\nEd Pentin has a long file of interviews and articles about Muller that clearly show his complete inability to make up his mind whose side he\u2019s on.\nA quick examination of Muller\u2019s interviews and statements reveal an irresolute and ultimately calculating mind of a man who is \u2013 so I am told by sources close to him \u2013 motivated mainly by a puerile desire to be approved of by the \u201ccool kids\u201d in the Vatican, on the one hand, and an unshakeable conviction of his own theological brilliance on the other.\nMost recently, on October 30th, Crux quoted him under the headline, \u201cCardinal Muller backs Pope Francis against critics of \u2018Amoris Laetitia\u2019\u201d in which the former head of the CDF has at last climbed on board the Kasperian train on reception of Communion for unrepentant adulterers.\nSignaling furiously with the trendy FrancisChurch buzzwords and even trendier blithering incoherence, Muller writes that \u201cmitigating factors in guilt,\u201d can lead, couples in \u201can uncertain marital situation\u201d through a \u201cpath of repentance\u201d \u2013 always \u201caccompanied\u201d by an exquisitely sensitive confessor \u2013 to a point where the reception of Communion is no longer sinful.\nPresumably because adultery itself is no longer sinful.\nOr sacrilege either, I guess.\nOr something.\nSomehow the \u201cnew evangelization\u201d is involved in this, though it\u2019s unclear how exactly it makes adultery and sacrilege OK. Also, it\u2019s very important to fulfill the Sunday Mass obligation, and as everyone knows, one can\u2019t possibly go to Mass on a Sunday without receiving Communion.\nWe hear again, as we did incessantly from the Kasperians at the Synods, about the hard case of the poor, poor woman who has been abandoned by the first husband, and who \u201cfinds no other way out than to entrust oneself to a kind-hearted person,\u201d \u2026 with whom, I guess, she has also no choice but to have sexual relations.\nBecause of kind-heartedness.\nAnyway, the result of this is a \u201cmarriage-like relationship\u201d about which confessors have to be very careful not to say mean things.\nOr be too \u201cextreme\u201d.\nIt\u2019s very important for him to avoid a \u201ccheap adaptation to the relativistic Zeitgeist,\u201d on one side, and a \u201ccold application of the dogmatic commandments and the canonical rules,\u201d on the other.\nBecause that could be too polarizing.\nAnd mean.\nAnd anyway, sins of the flesh aren\u2019t the worst things ever.\nThere are, like, \u201cdifferent levels\u201d of gravity, you know?\nAnd, like, it depends on the type of sin, right?\n\u201cSpirit\u2019s sins\u201d like spiritual pride and avarice and stuff, are worse than \u201csins of the flesh,\u201d you know?\nWhich are, like, only a result of \u201chuman weakness,\u201d right?\nApparently the real problem with this whole thing has been that the Kasperian kerfuffle has totally been blown way, way, WAY out of proportion, and the \u201cpolarization\u201d it has caused has been \u201cregrettable\u201d.\nThe question of Communion for divorced and civilly \u201cremarried\u201d Catholics, he said, has been \u201cfalsely elevated to the rank of a decisive question of Catholicism and a measure of ideological comparison in order to decide whether one is conservative or liberal, in favor or against the pope.\u201d\nFor years under Pope Benedict, Muller was engaged in an open war with the German episcopate who insisted that they were going to allow Communion for the divorced and remarried, no matter what Rome said, even threatening to go into schism if they didn\u2019t get their way[2].\nMuller, with little backing from Pope Benedict \u2013 who appeared content to allow his CDF prefect and the Germans shout out their differences \u2013 and with outright opposition from Francis, did indeed strive to hold the line.\nThe fact that Francis orchestrated the Synods to undermine him was certainly not his fault.\nAnd it is difficult to imagine anyone being in a worse position than he was at the time.\nBut since then, Muller has demonstrated very little of his former grit, instead attempting from one day to the next to appease both sides.\nReportedly removed from CDF \u2013 and of course lionized by \u201cconservatives\u201d \u2013 for his mild and equivocating opposition to Amoris Laetitia, Muller has gone back and forth in what can easily be seen as a desperate attempt to find friends in both camps.\nWith this in mind one could be forgiven for not taking his October 30th essay too seriously.\nPerhaps one of the good effects to come from Fr.\nWeinandy\u2019s persecution will be to demonstrate how a pastor of the Catholic Church is supposed to act.\nAs my friend said, maybe \u201cit\u2019s going to become harder and harder for men of conscience and position to sit on the fence,\u201d assuming there are any left.\nCatch Hilary's regular column in The Remnant's Print/E-edition.\nSubscribe Today!\n[1] In this interview, Fr.\nWeinandy gave a remarkable story of how his prayer for a \u201csign\u201d that he ought to write the letter was very specifically answered: \u201cIf you want me to write something, you have to give me a clear sign,\u201d Weinandy recalls saying.\n\u201cTomorrow morning, I\u2019m going to Saint Mary Major\u2019s to pray, and then I am going to Saint John Lateran.\nAfter that, I\u2019m coming back to Saint Peter\u2019s to have lunch with a seminary friend of mine.\u201d \u201cDuring that interval, I must meet someone that I know but have not seen in a very long time, and would never expect to see in Rome at this time.\nThat person cannot be from the United States, Canada or Great Britain.\nMoreover, that person has to say to me, \u2018Keep up the good writing\u2019.\u201d Weinandy said, exactly that happened the next day, in a chance meeting with an archbishop he\u2019d known a long time ago but not seen for over twenty years, who congratulated him for a book on the Incarnation and then said the right words, \u201cKeep up the good writing.\u201d \u201cThere was no longer any doubt in my mind that Jesus wanted me to write something,\u201d Weinandy said.\n[2] It\u2019s notable that these howling tantrums from the German bishops halted abruptly about the same time as Cardinal Kasper gave his infamous consistory speech in February 2014.\n", ["Repetition", "Appeal_to_fear-prejudice",

alone from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel is complete nonsense and that authorities are actually actively covering up what really happened on that fateful night.\nWhile there have been countless stories since the attack that raise the very real possibility that this was a false flag, one has stood out due to the fact that the person who released the information died shortly after.\nAs Shepard Ambellas reported in a now viral article, \u201cKymberley Suchomel, who posted her eyewitness account of the Las Vegas massacre in astonishingly vivid detail to her Facebook page on Oct. 4, subsequently passed away in her home on Oct. 9 from what reports are claiming are natural causes.\u201d\n\u201cShockingly, just days before her death, Suchomel posted key details about the

indicate the presence of multiple shooters, to the possibility of helicopters being used in the attack, the American people are clearly not being told the truth.\nIt is also important to keep in mind that multiple investigative reports conducted by other alternative media outlets have actually named government officials and private companies that may be behind the attack and so far there has been no official denial from either.\n", ["Loaded_Language", "Doubt"]], ["The Cunning CIA\nWhatever else might be said about the assassination of President Kennedy, one thing is for sure: The cover-up of this particular U.S. regime-change operation was one of the most ingenious and cunning plots ever designed.\nThis shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone, given that practically from its inception in 1947 the CIA was specializing in the arts of assassination, regime change, and cover-up.\nAs far back as 1953, the CIA published an assassination manual that the CIA succeeded in keeping secret from the American people for more than 40 years.\nIt came to light in 1997 as a result of a Freedom of Information request.\nThat was around the time that the Assassination Records Review Board, which was overseeing the mandatory release of JFK-related assassination records of the CIA and other federal agencies that had been kept secret from the American people since 1963.\nToday, Americans can read the CIA\u2019s assassination manual online.\nTitled \u201cStudy of Assassination,\u201d the manual spells out various ways to assassinate people.\nHere is what the manual states in part regarding the use of firearms:\nFirearms are often used in assassination, often very ineffectively\u2026.\nPublic figures or guarded officials may be killed with great reliability and some safety if a firing point can be established prior to an official occasion.\nThe propaganda value of this system may be very high.\nTime to buy old US gold coins\nThe manual also makes it clear that the CIA was studying ways to assassinate people without being detected.\nNote the following excerpt:\nFor secret assassination, either simple or chase, the contrived accident is the most effective technique.\nWhen successfully executed, it causes little excitement and is only casually investigated.\nIt would be safe to assume that the CIA continued developing and expanding on the assassination principles enunciated in that early assassination manual.\nThat\u2019s what we would expect from an agency whose specialties included assassination.\nWe can also assume that the CIA continued to refine the ways to avoid detection when assassinating someone.\nThe Kennedy Autopsy Jacob G Hornberger Best Price: $9.85 Buy New $9.95 (as of 03:35 EDT - Details)\nThe CIA published that secret assassination manual as part of its preparations for a U.S. regime-change operation in Guatemala, one that was designed to violently remove the nation\u2019s democratically elected socialist president, Jacobo Arbenz, from office and replace him with an unelected, right-wing, pro-U.S. military general.\nAs part of the Guatemala regime-change operation, the CIA prepared a list of Guatemalan officials to be assassinated.\nWhile the CIA has never revealed the names of the people it targeted for assassination, there is little doubt that Arbenz, the president, was at the top of the list.\nThere is something important to note: Neither Arbenz nor any other Guatemalan official had ever attacked the United States or even threatened to do so.\nSo, why were they targeted for assassination?\nBecause Arbenz had reached out to the Russians and Cubans in a spirit of peace and friendship, just as John Kennedy would do ten years later.\nThat\u2019s why the CIA targeted Guatemala for regime change and why it targeted Arbenz and other Guatemalan officials for assassination.\nAlthough Arbenz was able to escape the country, the CIA\u2019s regime-change operation was a total success, with Arbenz being replaced by the pro-U.S. Gen. Carlos Castillo Armas, who proceeded to instigate a reign of terror across Guatemala.\nThe Guatemalan operation was brilliant and ingenious.\nThe CIA officials were secretly honored for protecting \u201cnational security\u201d by removing President Arbenz from office and replacing him with a pro-U.S. military general.\nTracy Barnes, one of the CIA officials responsible for the operation, was awarded the Distinguished Intelligence Medal, the CIA\u2019s second-highest medal.\nThe CIA\u2019s cover-up in the JFK assassination was even more brilliant and ingenious.\nThe doctors at Parkland Hospital stated that President Kennedy had a big exit-sized wound in the back of his head, which implied a shot having been fired from the front.\nAt a press conference immediately after the president died, two treating physicians stated that the other wound \u2014 the one in the front of Kennedy\u2019s neck \u2014 was an entry wound, which implied that Kennedy had been hit by another shot fired from the front.\nThis necessarily meant that Kennedy had been shot from the front, not the rear, where accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was situated.\nKeep in mind something important: After he was arrested, Oswald claimed his innocence.\nBut he also went a step further.\nHe said that he was being framed for the crime.\nThe obvious question arises: Why frame an innocent man who is situated in the rear by killing the president with shots fired from the front?\nWouldn\u2019t it be more logical to either have the shots fired from the rear, where Oswald was, or, alternatively, place Oswald in the front, where the shots were fired?\nThat\u2019s where the brilliance, ingenuity, and cunningness of the cover-up come into play.\nIf Oswald is in the rear and since shots are fired from the front, that could mean only one thing: that Oswald had confederates firing from the front.\nWho would those confederates be?\nThere could be only one answer: communists.\nSoviet and Cuban communists, to be more specific.\nHow would we know this?\nThat\u2019s where Oswald\u2019s trip to Mexico City right before the assassination comes into play.\nRegime Change: The JFK...

Jefferson Morley Check Amazon for Pricing.\nwould see it during the morning of the assassination, which took place after noon.\nNo matter how good a frame-up was, the CIA knew that it could be detected with an aggressive investigation.\nThat\u2019s where ingenuity and cunning come into play.\nThey had to figure out a way to shut down the investigation so that the frame-up would remain intact.\nThat\u2019s why they had shots fired from the front and placed Oswald in the rear.\nThe idea was that since an investigation would lead to Oswald\u2019s supposed communist confederates in the front, which in turn would lead to nuclear war, the investigation had to be shut down immediately, especially since it was the CIA itself that had started the assassination game by repeatedly attempting, in partnership with the Mafia, to assassinate Castro.\nIt was one of the most brilliant and cunning ruses in history.\nThey get the body out of Parkland by force, in violation of Texas law, and put it in the hands of the military in Maryland, which conducts a secret fraudulent and bogus autopsy.\n(See my book The Kennedy Autopsy.)\nLyndon Johnson telephones Dallas District Attorney Henry Wade on the night of the assassination and orders him to shut down any investigation of a conspiracy because it might lead to nuclear war.\nAs soon as Oswald is assassinated, the FBI orders Wade to turn over all his investigative files to the FBI.\nAt the same time, Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and FBI Head J. Edgar Hoover both write secret memos and reports saying any further investigation must stop immediately.\nLyndon Johnson gets Earl Warren and Sen. Richard Russel to join the Warren Commission by telling them that the assassination could lead to World War III.\nJohnson appoints former CIA Director Allan Dulles, who Kennedy had fired as a result of the CIA\u2019s regime-change operation at the Bay of Pigs, to the Warren Commission, thereby guaranteeing that there will be no investigation of the CIA.\nThen keep all the records secret for decades, when many people won\u2019t care anymore who killed President Kennedy.\nAnd employ Operation Mockingbird-like journalistic assets in the private sector to flood the market with alternative \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d to confound and confuse the public.\nAnd smear anyone who questions the official narrative as a \u201ccommunist sympathizer\u201d or a \u201cconspiracy theorist.\u201d\nThe CIA\u2019s cunning cover-up in the JFK assassination worked brilliantly.\nThanks to President Trump and the CIA\u2019s decision to continue keeping 98 percent of the CIA\u2019s decades-long secret records secret from the American people, the CIA\u2019s cunning cover-up of the JFK assassination continues to work brilliantly today.\nReprinted with permission from The Future of Freedom Foundation.\nThe Best of Jacob G.

and humiliating reversals in various forums and venues, those pushing for boycotts, divestment and sanctions (BDS) against Israel have not dispensed with their pernicious campaign of hate.\nThe latest outrage perpetrated by BDS activists occurred at McGill University, where a Jewish student and two non-Jewish students identified as pro-Israel were removed from their positions as directors of the Students Society of McGill University (SSMU).\nAt the end of his second year, Noah Lew, who is currently third year undergraduate student at McGill University, applied to serve as Director of the School\u2019s student society.\nHe was warned by others who had prior dealings with the SSMU, to keep his Jewish identity secret lest he sabotage his chances.\nThis is the atmosphere that Jewish students and supporters of Israel must endure on a daily basis at McGill.\nThe toxic environment is due almost exclusively to an active and vocal presence of BDS agitators on campus.\nLew followed the advice and was elected as a board member.\nHis \u201csecret\u201d was intact.\nBDS provocateurs at McGill had relentlessly tried and failed to pass boycott resolutions against Israel.\nIn fact, three attempts within an 18-month period were quashed.\nFinally, in June 2016, SSMU\u2019s Judicial Board ruled that the BDS campaign and efforts to institute it at McGill ran counter to the McGill\u2019s undergraduate student union constitution.\nThe Board\u2019s ruling, which is called a \u201creference,\u201d was then referred to SSMU\u2019s directors for ratification.\nSSMU\u2019s Board of Directors addressed the issue more than a year after the \u201creference.\u201d Lew and other board members passionately advocated in favor of ratification and their arguments ultimately prevailed over the naysayers.\nThe malevolent BDS campaign at McGill had belatedly come to an ignominious end; or so we thought.\nLew and two other directors identified as either Jewish or pro-Israel became instant targets of a campaign of hate laced with blatant anti-Semitic overtones.\nCampus BDS groups held several meetings to formulate a response and founded the so-called \u201cDemocratize SSMU\u201d movement.\nBut Democratize SSMU was anything but democratic.\nIts raison d'\u00eatre was to seek the removal of Jewish and anti-BDS students from SSMU\u2019s Board of Directors and place BDS back on the agenda.\nAs an aside, one of the more vocal proponents of BDS at McGill is a rancid character named Igor Sadikov, who in February posted a comment on twitter advocating violence against \u201cZionists.\u201d As a result, he was forced to resign his position as an SSMU director but dodged an impeachment effort to have him stripped of his position at McGill\u2019s Arts Undergraduate Society.\nSadikov made light of his \u201cpunch a Zionist\u201d tweet calling it a \u201cmisguided joke.\u201d It does not appear that Sadikov was subjected to any form of school disciplinary action despite the fact that his call for violence violated McGill\u2019s Code of Conduct.\nMcGill\u2019s BDS Action Network actively campaigned against Lew and two other board members because of their links to Jewish groups and anti-BDS stances.\nDemocratize SSMU shamefully highlighted Lew\u2019s ethnicity as a reason for his removal.\nAn enlightened, progressive school was suddenly transformed into something harking back to the days of Nazi Germany and the Nuremberg Laws.\nIn October, SSMU\u2019s General Assembly moved to ratify the 12-member Board of Directors.\nAccording to Lew, \u201chistorically, the Board of Directors had been ratified as a bloc, all 12 at a time.\u201d But BDS activists who showed up for the General Assembly ratification forced the voting to occur on an individual basis rather than a block as was the accepted protocol.\nIn this manner, BDS/ Democratize SSMU activists managed to pick off their opponents one at a time.\nIt was repulsive display leftist-fascist bigotry at its worst.\nThe bigoted BDS provocateurs applauded as Lew and the other two board members were removed from their posts.\nBut this time, they may have gone too far.\nEven by BDS standards, their manifestly anti-Semitic campaign antics were beyond the pale.\nBDS activists generally avoid reference to \u201cJews\u201d by name because it is impolitic and commonly substitute \u201cZionists\u201d for Jews even though most of us are cognizant of their true intentions.\nBut in the instant case, McGill\u2019s BDS campaigners dispensed with their traditional charade and overtly launched their attack against Jews.\nThe vitriolic BDS campaign immediately sparked outrage among watchdog groups and politicians prompting McGill principal, Suzanne Fortier, to announce that the school would be conducting an investigation into the matter.\nEven SSMU president, Muna Tojiboeva, voiced support for Lew and expressed the belief that antisemitism played a key role in the ousting the three board members.\nOne can only hope that Fortier takes the issue seriously and conducts a proper investigation, which leads to disciplinary action.\nJudging by past \u201cinvestigations\u201d conducted by other schools \u2013 SFSU, CUNY and UCI, to name a few \u2013 I am not optimistic.\n", ["Repetition", "Doubt", "Appeal_to_fear-prejudice",

\u201cAnother Active Shooter\u201d In The Bar At The Top Of The Mandalay Bay Hotel During The Attack\nNewly released audio from the Clark County Fire Department has provided even more proof that there were multiple shooters during The Las Vegas Massacre, further debunking the official narrative of a lone gunman on the 32nd floor and once again calling into question almost every aspect of what actually happened during the worst mass shooting in American history.\nThe audio, released on the SoundCloud account of a local news reporter, is an almost three hour recording of transmissions between dispatch and units on the ground amid the confusion of the mass shooting that at one point details a report that a wife of a firefighter was actually pinned down in the Foundation Room bar on top of the Mandalay Hotel.\nIntellihub\u2019s Shepard Ambellas, who has extensively reported on the entire Vegas cover-up since the beginning, recently found that at around the 1:27:54 mark of the audio file you can clearly hear dispatch describing the situation to first responders who are headed in that direction.\n\u201cWe have a firefighter\u2019s wife at this event who is pinned down behind the bar at Mandalay Bay.\nWe are trying to get further on the name,\u201d dispatch frantically notes.\n\u201cBatallion 6, be advised that we are getting reports on Mandalay Bay, at the bar, we currently have, another active shooter up there.\u201d\nAfter being asked to confirm the information, dispatch goes on to make clear that she is specifically speaking about the bar at the top of the hotel rather than anywhere near the 32nd floor room that Stephen Paddock supposedly operated from.\n\u201cThe only information I have is it\u2019s the bar on top of the Mandalay Bay,\u201d dispatch continues before being asked if the shooter was pinned down or \u201cjust sheltering right now?\u201d\nInterestingly, the story doesn\u2019t end there, as Ambellas wrote in his piece, author and entrepreneur Grant Cardone was actually holding an investors meeting in the very same bar shortly before the attack took place.\nThe popular social media influencer apparently left the Foundation Room literally seven minutes before authorities claim Paddock opened fire from his 32nd floor room.\nCardone wrote about his experience in a post on Medium in which he claimed that the Mandalay Bay was telling visitors that there was at least one active shooter, \u201cmoving\u201d throughout the hotel shooting people.\nIt was reported by the Mandalay there was a shooter moving through the hotel.\nI told Elena and Johnny, \u201cstay close to me, we are not running out, stay calm, there is one person in charge \u2014 where I go, you follow, no matter what.\u201d [\u2026] About this time, there was starting to be a lot more activity through the casino and now the reports suggested there was active multiple terrorists moving through the hotel shooting guest.\nThen twitter started showing up with feeds suggesting multiple hotels being attacked, bomb threats, and more.\nThis new report documenting yet another instance of a possible second shooter comes on the heels of dozens of similar reports, with the most recent arriving in the form of air traffic control audio that directly stated that there were active shooters on the runway.\n\u201cDuring the air traffic control recordings, which were released by political strategist and co-founder of \u201cThe New Right\u201d Mike Tokes, one of the dispatchers is heard telling an incoming plane that landing might not be a good idea because there were multiple active shooters on the airport property itself,\u201d SHTFplan reported.\n\u201cShutting down might not be a good idea, there\u2019s active shooters on the runway,\u201d he declared.\n\u201cThe 19s are closed, we are in the process of trying to round them up, they are on the airport property.\u201d\nAir traffic control tapes on the night of the Las Vegas shooting:

world has heard of the publication of a devastating letter to Pope Francis from Father Thomas G. Weinandy.\nThe former head of the theological secretariat of the U.S. Bishop\u2019s conference, Fr.\nWeinandy has taught at both Oxford and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.\nNone other than Francis appointed Fr.\nWeinandy to the International Theological Commission and awarded him the Pro Pontifice et Ecclesiae medal, the ecclesial equivalent of the Congressional Medal of Honor, for his work on behalf of the Pope and the Church.\nOne of the world\u2019s most renowned theologians, Fr.\nWeinandy is a \u201cman of the Council\u201d and a prominent figure of the post-conciliar mainstream.\nYet Fr.\nWeinandy\u2019s letter, sent to Francis privately last summer but predictably ignored by him\u2014along with every other private entreaty concerning his destructive activity\u2014is a withering indictment of a papacy that constitutes nothing less than a menace to the Church.\nThe key passages (paragraph breaks added) rebuke Francis for his recklessness, his deliberate ambiguity, his fomenting of error, his sowing of disunity, his unheard-of calumnies of the faithful, and even his reduction of the faith to an ideology\u2014precisely the wrong of which he accuses orthodox Catholics:\nYour Holiness, a chronic confusion seems to mark your pontificate\u2026.\nThis fosters within the faithful a growing unease \u2026.\nIn \"Amoris Laetitia,\" your guidance at times seems intentionally ambiguous, thus inviting both a traditional interpretation of Catholic teaching on marriage and divorce as well as one that might imply a change in that teaching\u2026.\nTo teach with such a seemingly intentional lack of clarity inevitably risks sinning against the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of truth.\nThe Holy Spirit is given to the Church, and particularly to yourself, to dispel error, not to foster it.\n[Y]ou seem to censor and even mock those who interpret Chapter 8 of \"Amoris Laetitia\" in accord with Church tradition as Pharisaic stone-throwers who embody a merciless rigorism.\nThis kind of calumny is alien to the nature of the Petrine ministry\u2026.\nSuch behavior gives the impression that your views cannotsurvive theological scrutiny, and so must be sustained by \u201cad hominem\u201d arguments.\n[T]oo often your manner seems to demean the importance of Church doctrine.\nAgain and again you portray doctrine as dead and bookish, and far from the pastoral concerns of everyday life.\nYour critics have been accused, in your own words, of making doctrine an ideology.\nBut it is precisely Christian doctrine\u2026 that frees people from worldly ideologies and assures that they are actually preaching and teaching the authentic, life-giving Gospel.\nThose who devalue the doctrines of the Church [i.e., Francis!]\nseparate themselves from Jesus, the author of truth\u2026 What they [i.e., Francis] then possess, and can only possess, is an ideology \u2013 one that conforms to the world of sin and death.\n[F]aithful Catholics can only be disconcerted by your choice of some bishops, men who seem not merely open to those who hold views counter to Christian belief but who support and even defend them.\nWhat scandalizes believers, and even some fellow bishops, is not only your having appointed such men to be shepherds of the Church, but that you also seem silent in the face of their teaching and pastoral practice\u2026.\nAs a result, many of the faithful, who embody the \"sensus fidelium,\" are losing confidence in their supreme shepherd.\n[T]he Church is one body, the Mystical Body of Christ, and you are commissioned by the Lord himself to promote and strengthen her unity.\nBut your actions and words too often seem intent on doing the opposite\u2026.\nYou have often spoken about the need for transparency within the Church.\nYou have frequently encouraged\u2026 all persons, especially bishops, to speak their mind and not be fearful of what the pope may think.\nBut\u2026 what many [bishops] have learned from your pontificate is not that you are open to criticism, but that you resent it\u2026 Many fear that if they speak their mind, they will be marginalized or worse.\nI have often asked myself: \"Why has Jesus let all of this happen?\"\nThe only answer that comes to mind is that Jesus wants to manifest just how weak is the faith of many within the Church, even among too many of her bishops.\nIronically, your pontificate has given those who hold harmful theological and pastoral views the license and confidence to come into the light and expose their previously hidden darkness\u2026.\nFather Weinandy reveals that he decided to publicize this historic missive only after receiving an unmistakable sign from heaven.\nAs he recounts here, after repeatedly \u201cbeseeching Jesus and Mary, St. Peter and all of the saintly popes who are buried there to do something to rectify the confusion and turmoil within the Church today, a chaos and an uncertainty that I felt Pope Francis had himself caused,\u201d he asked for a minutely specific sign from heaven on whether he should write the letter: that the next day he would meet someone he had not seen in a very long time, would never expect to see in Rome, and was not from the United States, Canada or Great Britain, which person would utter the particular phrase: \u201cKeep up the good writing.\u201d\nAt lunch the next day, the sign was given.\nAn old friend he had not seen in more than twenty years and would never have expected to meet in Rome, who is now an archbishop, appeared suddenly from between two parked cars, renewed acquaintances and, referring to one of Father Weinandy\u2019s books, said: \u201cKeep up the good writing.\u201d\nWrites Fr.\nWeinandy: \u201cI could hardly believe that this just happened in a matter of a few minutes.\nBut there was no longer any doubt in my mind that Jesus wanted me to write something.\nI also think it significant that it was an Archbishop that Jesus used.\nI considered it an apostolic mandate.\u201d\nCan we doubt that it was indeed an apostolic mandate?\nCan we not see in Fr.\nWeinandy a voice raised up by heaven itself to

applications were reviewed by the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the immigration courts.\nThe claims were rejected as unsubstantiated and the illegal aliens ordered deported.\nHowever, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) declined to enforce those deportation orders, called Final Order Of Removal\nDuring the 10 or so years that the cases involving Indonesian Christians were free to remain in the United States, those illegal aliens did not make any effort to appeal their outstanding orders.\nThen the United States had an election, and the policy of not enforcing those and many other Final Orders of Removal was ended.\nThen suddenly, those illegal aliens claimed they were being denied an opportunity to file for asylum or were not receiving due process.\nThey filed a case in the Federal courts and were assigned to a Kritarch, Patti Saris, who apparently thinks she runs immigration policy, even after aliens have had their day in court.\nSaris thinks she can usurp the Constitution of the United States based on her whims regarding immigration policy.\nKritarch Patti Saris\nIn her latest excursion into immigration enforcement policy, she decided that illegal aliens can't be held in custody for their return to their home country.\nBOSTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday ordered the release of an illegal immigrant who is among 47 Indonesians in New Hampshire challenging the Trump administration\u2019s order to deport them.\nThe man, Terry Rombot, had been allowed to remain under the terms of a 2010 deal with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement until this year, when President Donald Trump instructed ICE that all people living in the United States illegally were subject to deportation.\n[U.S. Judge Frees Indonesian Immigrant Held By Trump Order, by Nate Raymond, Reuters, November 1, 2017]\nFirst, let's deal with the misleading reporting.\nRombot was not taken into custody based on any ICE policy of deporting all illegal aliens.\nRombot was taken into custody because he had an outstanding Final Order Of Removal; that's a big difference and symptomatic of the lies from reporters like Raymond.\nSaris previously ordered a stay to the deportations.\nShe is currently weighing whether she can order a longer delay to give the affected people time to renew their efforts to gain legal status.\nNow, with regard to Saris, she has no authority to interfere with the pre-deportation custody of an illegal alien with a Final Order Of Removal.\nRombot was taken into custody because he was soon to be deported.\nThere was no issue of Indonesia not accepting him nor of Indonesia not providing a travel document, so there was no question of him being held in custody longer than allowed in the St. Cyr decision that restricted custody of illegal aliens with Final Orders Of Removal who for whatever reason were unlikely to be successfully deported.\nShe still thinks that she can review the underlying decision of the immigration court as well.In fact, Saris' actions appear to more akin to that of the Mexican kritarch Monica Herranz who aided an illegal alien to escape arrest by ICE when she let that illegal alien leave her courtroom through the exit to her judicial chambers.\nSaris is clearly scheming to help Rombot escape deportation by disappearing into the almost 1 million illegal aliens absconding from Final Orders of Removal\nTime for Congress to impeach Saris and to remove authority from lesser courts to review immigration law enforcement, detention, and deportation decisions.\n",

plague has already infected 2,000 in Madagascar and killed 143 in the country\u2019s worst outbreak in 50 years.\nBut health officials are now warning the deadly bacteria could mutate and become untreatable as it spreads across the globe.\nCoupled with the high likelihood that this disease could spread globally by an infected traveler getting on a plane to Europe or America, health officials are now warning that the strain of plague which has already killed more than 140 Madagascar could mutate and become untreatable.\nProfessor Paul Hunter has warned that, while it would be rather easy for an advanced country to contain the disease in its current form, he fears that it could evolve into something far more dangerous.\nHunter, who is a disease expert at the University of East Anglia, told the Daily Star: \u201cIf it reaches the UK, Europe or the US it would be similar to the Ebola outbreak.\nWe would have a few isolated cases but it shouldn\u2019t spread like it has in Madagascar.\u201d But he had more to add.\n\u201cAs with any disease, it\u2019s a real worry that it mutates and become untreatable,\u201d Hunter said.\nSo far, the majority of the recent cases of the black death have the been pneumonic plague, a more deadly form of the bubonic plague which devastated Europe\u2019s population in the 1300s.\nWhile the bubonic plague is spread through the bites of infected fleas, pneumonic plague is spread through the air, usually by coughing.\nAirborne infections are difficult at best to control.\nSymptoms of the plague include a very high fever, coughing (potentially coughing up blood), and headaches.\nTen African nations have already been put on alert that the plague could easily spread to their region of the globe.\nThe plague can be fatal 24-48 hours after infection, but antibiotics will take care of the infection.\nSchools and universities have been closed with a ban issued on public gatherings, such as the tradition of \u201cdancing with the dead\u201d which has been partially blamed for the disease\u2019s spread.\nThe current outbreak is also highly unusual as it has affected urban areas increasing the risk of transmission, according to the World Health Organization.\nWHO has delivered 1.2 million doses of antibiotics to fight the disease while the Red Cross has been training hundreds of volunteers on the island to publicize preventative measures.\n", ["Repetition", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Appeal_to_fear-prejudice"]], ["Did Saint Francis Predict Pope Francis?\nTraditionalists are often derided by neo-Catholic commentators for relying on supposedly apocryphal quotations from Popes or saints bearing on the current ecclesial crisis.\nBut these critics never demonstrate that the oft-cited quotations are apocryphal; they merely assert that they must be, as they seem too probative to be true.\nThis is often done in comment boxes or responses to online queries at neo-Catholic websites, wherein the neo-Catholic commentator professes he can find no source for a given quotation\u2014meaning he hasn\u2019t bothered to do any serious investigation beyond a few Google searches.\nTake this quotation of Pius XII, for example, speaking in 1931 when he was still Monsignor Pacelli, serving as Pius XI\u2019s Secretary of State:\nI am worried by the Blessed Virgin\u2019s messages to Lucy of Fatima.\nThis persistence of Mary about the dangers which menace the Church is a divine warning against the suicide that would be represented by the alteration of the faith, in her liturgy, her theology and her soul\u2026.\nI hear all around me innovators who wish to dismantle the Sacred Chapel, destroy the universal flame of the Church, reject her ornaments and make her feel remorse for her historical past.\nA day will come when the civilized world will deny its God, when the Church will doubt as Peter doubted.\nShe will be tempted to believe that man has become God.\nIn our churches, Christians will search in vain for the red lamp where God awaits them.\nLike Mary Magdalene, weeping before the empty tomb, they will ask, \u201cWhere have they taken Him?\u201d\nWhen I first cited this quotation some 17 years ago, I was contacted by a very prominent neo-Catholic luminary who demanded a source for it, because he and his friends believed it was \u201capocryphal.\u201d I did not receive the courtesy of a thank-you when I pointed him to pp.\n52-53 of Msgr.\nRoche\u2019s biography of Pius XII, Pie XII Devant L\u2019Histoire (Paris: Editions Robert Laffont, 1972), an out-of-print French-language work I managed to obtain after an extensive search of used book seller inventory.\nThe French original text confirms the accuracy of the English translation I had seen before I cited the statement.\nA Modernist apostate priest, one Emile Poulet, who left the priesthood and married, attempted to cast doubt on the credibility of Msgr.\nRoche\u2019s account of the words of the future Pius XII.\nSmall wonder: Poulet, who died in 2014 at the age of 94, belonged to the \u201cworker-priest\u201d movement that none other than Pius XII had condemned, as I note here.\nHis attempt to debunk the quotation involved nit-picking about what he claimed were factual errors elsewhere in the Roche biography.\nBut he had no evidence that the quotation as such was a fabrication.\nHe simply wished that it was so.\nLet\u2019s give our neo-Catholic friends another \u201capocryphal\u201d quotation to dismiss out of hand.\nThis one pertains to an astonishing prophecy by Saint Francis of Assisi about a future occupant of the Chair of Peter:\nA short time before the holy Father\u2019s [St. Francis\u2019] death, he called together his children and warned them of the coming troubles:\n\u201cAct bravely, my brethren; take courage and trust in the Lord.\nThe time is fast approaching in which there will be great trials and afflictions; perplexities and dissensions, both spiritual and temporal, will abound; the charity of many will grow cold, and the malice of the wicked will increase.\nThe devils will have unusual power; the immaculate purity of our Order, and of others, will be so much obscured that there will be very few Christians who obey the true Supreme Pontiff and the Roman Church with loyal ears and perfect charity.\n\u201cAt the time of this tribulation a man, not canonically elected, will be raised to the Pontificate, who, by his cunning, will endeavour to draw many into error and death.\nThen scandals will be multiplied, our Order will be divided, and many others will be entirely destroyed, because they will consent to error instead of opposing it.\n\u201cThere will be such diversity of opinions and schisms among the people, the religious and the clergy, that, except those days were shortened, according to the words of the Gospel, even the elect would be led into error, were they not specially guided, amid such great confusion, by the immense mercy of God\u2026.\n\u201cThose who persevere in their fervor and adhere to virtue with love and zeal for the truth, will suffer injuries and persecutions as rebels and schismatics; for their persecutors, urged on by the evil spirits, will say they are rendering a great service to God by destroying such pestilent men from the face of the earth\u2026\n\u201cSome preachers will keep silent about the truth, and others will trample it under foot and deny it.\nSanctity of life will be held in derision even by those who outwardly profess it, for in those days Our Lord Jesus Christ will send them, not a true Pastor, but a destroyer.\u201d [paragraph breaks added]\nThis quotation appears in Works of the Seraphic Father, St. Francis of Assisi, published in 1882 by the London-based Catholic publishing house R. Washbourne, 1882, pp.\n248-250).\nIt is readily available as a Google book.\nThe same book, it must be noted, contains an appendix setting forth \u201cDoubtful Works of Saint Francis,\u201d of which the quotation is not part.\nThus, the publisher itself carefully distinguished the authentic prophecies of Saint Francis from what might be apocryphal.\nMoreover, in 1882 there could hardly have been any \u201cradical traditionalist\u201d motive to circulate phony quotations of the saint.\n\"St. Francis in Ecstacy\", Caravaggio, 1595\nSaint Francis\u2019 prophecy is clearly not a prediction of the Great Western Schism (1378-1417), which did not involve a \u201cdestroyer\u201d on the Chair of Peter who leads the faithful into error, widespread apostasy, and the persecution of faithful Catholics as \u201cschismatics.\u201d But it does contain elements very familiar to us today.\nAnd what inference might one draw from the coincidence that Saint Francis\u2019 prophecy of a future \u201cdestroyer\u201d in the papal office seems to correspond rather well with the pontificate of the only Pope who has taken Francis\u2019 name as his own?\nSomething else to consider: Saint Francis, one of the greatest saints in Church history, one of the few who is known and revered by the whole world, freely revealed his vision of an ecclesial destroyer who usurps the papal office.\nThat is, Saint Francis did not suffer from the currently reigning papolatry, which holds that the indefectibility of the Church depends upon defending every word and deed of a given Pope as somehow consistent with Tradition and declares absolutely inadmissible the idea that the holder of the Petrine office could be a threat to the integrity of the Faith.\nRather, Saint Francis, illuminated by heaven itself, recognized the coming reality of what Saint Robert Bellarmine, a Doctor of the Church, hypothesized as possible in principle, to cite another \u201capocryphal\u201d quotation:\nJust as it is licit to resist the Pontiff that aggresses the body, it is also licit to resist the one who aggresses souls or who disturbs civil order, or, above all, who attempts to destroy the Church.\nI say that it is licit to resist by not doing what he orders and by preventing his will from being executed\u2026\nDe Controversiis on the Roman Pontiff, trans.\nRyan Grant (Mediatrix Press: 2015), Book II, Chapter 29, p. 303.\nDid Saint Francis predict the coming of Pope Francis?\nThat is not for us to judge, although the Church may\u00ad well issue a judgment of Francis like that of the posthumous anathema of Honorius\u00ad\u00ad I.\nWould Saint Francis have been horrified by the words and deeds of the Pope who has presumed to take his name?\nThat question answers itself.\n",

\u201cHelicopter Hovering Overhead\u201d During The Attack\nNewly released footage of the Las Vegas Massacre, captured by a private surveillance camera and recently released by Fox News host Tucker Carlson, has once again ignited the theory that helicopters were used during the horrific attack.\nOver the last month multiple videos have been released that many believe show helicopters either conducting an attack on the Vegas Strip or attempting to stop those that were and now, with this latest evidence release, that possibility seems all the more plausible.\nAs Shepard Ambellas reported for Intellihub, \u201cThe [footage] is presumed to have been captured by a nearby business\u2019s southward facing security camera which is located approximately 780 feet due east of the venue where the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival was held on Oct. 1.\nThe tape was given to Fox News by an attorney who represents several shooting victims.\u201d\nAmazingly, the surveillance camera captured what seems to show a \u201clarge amount\u201d of wind and debris being kicked up by a nearby helicopter hovering above the attack and or taking part in it.\n\u201cAstonishingly, between the times of 10:13 and 10:16 a good amount of debris can be seen being pushed downward and sideways in front of the camera,\u201d Ambellas continued.\n\u201cBy 10:14 much larger crowds of people can be seen streaming through the area to escape the massacre going on,\u201d Carlson reported.\n\u201cYou can see a large amount of wind and debris, apparently that is due to a helicopter hovering overhead.\u201d\nThe footage goes how to show two men attempt to help a victim who had apparently been shot, eventually resorting to covering up the body after they realized it was simply too late.\nAmbellas also reported on what his research indicates were documented helicopters in the air at the time.\nA quick review of flight records during that time reveals that a squadron of EC-130 Eurocopters departed from Maverick Leasing LLC at 10:12 p.m., several of which appear to have overflown the parking lot where the victim and debris were seen.\nHowever, the departure of the choppers and the fact that several of them overflew the parking lot does not explain all of the debris being kicked up from by a heavy downdraft, prop wash, possibly from a helicopter hovering in place much closer.\nIn fact, the downdraft appears to be constant from 10:13-10:16 p.m. and not intermittent as if several choppers had just passed overhead.\nAs I have reported in the past, multiple other videos taken on the night of the attack also seem to point to helicopters being used throughout the city.\n\u201cFootage has emerged that may show muzzle flashes coming from the helicopter in what looks to be evidence that a team was firing into the crowd from the air on that fateful night,\u201d read a report in The Daily Sheeple.\n\u201cDespite claims by some that these are \u201cstrobes\u201d it remains unlikely that this is the case, especially when you consider other footage of the helicopter taken on the night as well as research by a group of investigators who believe the first attack on October 1st was carried out from the air.\u201d\nIt is also important to keep in mind that there is footage of a still unidentified team loading up gear in a helicopter near the scene of the attack.\n\u201cIn what can only be described as a \u201cWTF video\u201d the following footage seems to literally show a team of unknown soldiers gearing up next to a helicopter near the Route 91 concert.\u201d\nAdditionally, Carlson also noted during the initial broadcast of the private surveillance footage that the owner of the camera was never approached by the FBI, who have so far never seen the footage, much less investigated it.\nWhile we may never know what actually happened during the Las Vegas Massacre, the fact remains that the official story has been proven, time and time again, to be absolutely false and in fact nothing more than a pathetic attempt at a cover-up.\n", ["Loaded_Language", "Doubt"]], ["America's Immigration Voice.\nEver thought that the academic

been infected down by a more lethal form of the black death so far in the country, which lies off the coast of Africa, according to WHO statistics.\nSome experts fear the disease (which is so deadly because it is airborne) could mutate and become untreatable during this year\u2019s outbreak \u2013 which is expected to blight Madagascar until April.\nOthers worry the plague will go beyond mainland Africa and eventually reach the US, Europe, and Britain.\nThe plague spreads easily and can kill within 48 hours.\nThat would leave millions more vulnerable to the outbreak, and create a short supply of life-saving antibiotics.\nAccording to the Daily Mail, experts warn the outbreak of plague in Madagascar this year is being fueled by a strain more lethal than the one which usually strikes the country.\nThis form of the pneumonic plague is airborne, easily spread by a cough or a sneeze, and has been responsible for two-thirds of all infections this year.\nThe bubonic form of the plague, responsible for the \u201cBlack Death\u201d in the 14th century strikes the country each year and infects around 600 people.\nBut with over 2000 alread infected by pneumonic plague (and counting) health officials aren\u2019t willing to quit sounding alarms just yet.\nPaul Hunter, a professor of health protection at the world-renowned University of East Anglia, was the first expert to predict the plague could travel across the sea.\nHe previously said: \u201cThe big anxiety is it could spread to mainland Africa, it\u2019s not probable, but certainly possible, that might then be difficult to control.\nIf we don\u2019t carry on doing stuff here, at one point something will happen and it will get out of our control and cause huge devastation all around the world.\u201d There is always a risk with travel that the disease will spread globally, Hunter added.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want a situation where the disease spreads so fast it gets out of control.\nWe are talking about it spreading in days rather than weeks.\u201d But Hunter is adamant that a well-developed country could manage the plague should a global outbreak occur.\nHopefully, most will never have to find out how well another country can manage this infection.\nA few health experts have warned that there is no threat to the UK, however, some have warned the plague outbreak will certainly spread to the region.\nRichard Conroy, the founder of Sick Holiday, has sent a chilling warning to UK authorities.\nConway is saying it\u2019s \u201conly a matter of time\u201d before the disease arrives on British

It Is \u2018Inevitable\u2019 The Plague Becomes Resistant To Drugs\nThe newest warning about the outbreak of the airborne pneumonic plague, or black death, in Madagascar has been released.\nOfficials warn that it\u2019s inevitable that this bacterial infection that\u2019s infected over 2000 people will become resistant to antibiotics.\nThe only way to treat a person who has contracted the plague is with antibiotics.\nBut experts now warn that because they are being used so much to treat the infection, antibiotics resistance is inevitable and making this disease much more terrifying.\nOnce the bacteria is resistant, the Madagascar healthcare system will be overwhelmed, and the disease will have control of the nation.\nAccording to the Daily Mail, Madagascar\u2019s healthcare system will be unable to cope if the deadly plague outbreak continues to escalate, a scientist has warned.\nScores of doctors and nurses have been struck down with the disease, which is predicted to gather momentum in the coming weeks and there are growing fears hospitals will be unable to meet the illness\u2019 burden.\nOfficial figures reveal at least 2,034 people have been infected with the \u201cmedieval disease\u201d so far in what has been described as the \u201cworst outbreak in 50 years.\u201d The black death outbreak has so far claimed at least 165 lives.\nAlthough the plague is responding well to antibiotics right now, drug resistance is also an increasing concern amongst experts who predict it will vastly accelerate the disease\u2019s death toll.\nProfessor John Joe McFadden from the University of Surrey told MailOnline: \u201cFortunately in [the] plague, it has not developed much antibiotic resistance.\nIf that kicks in, the plague will be far, far scarier.\nIf you throw more and more antibiotics at patients, antibiotic resistance is more or less inevitable.\u201d\nDr. Derek Gatherer, from Lancaster University\u2019s biomedical and life-sciences department, told MailOnline the country would struggle \u201cto cope\u201d if cases continue to spiral.\n\u201cMadagascar, typically like many African countries, doesn\u2019t have many doctors.\nThere are around three-and-a-half thousand doctors for 22 million people.\nThey only have around 6,000 hospital beds, so they aren\u2019t particularly well positioned to cope with these kind of events.\nAnd if it wasn\u2019t for the international aid coming in things would definitely be much worse for them.\u201d\nAnd experts continue to fear the healthcare system is on the brink of being overwhelmed.\nShould the disease actually spread to the African mainland, it will be all but impossible to control and the health care system would certainly be unable to handle the outbreak at that point, making a global pandemic much more likely.\n", ["Repetition", "Appeal_to_fear-prejudice", "Exaggeration,Minimisation", "Name_Calling,Labeling", "Appeal_to_Authority"]], ["Al Franken Is Just The Beginning As The Curtain Is Pulled Back In Washington DC\nAl Franken Is Just The Beginning As The Curtain Is Pulled Back In Washington DC\nPlease help support us with cryptocurrency donations.\nThank you!\nFor decades, Americans have known that very sick things happen behind the scenes in Washington D.C., but the mainstream media nearly really talks about any of it.\nBut now the curtain is starting to be pulled back, and the revelations about Al Franken are just the beginning.\nEarlier this week, I wrote an article about how \u201csexual harassment is rampant in the halls of Congress\u201d, and that was before a female radio anchor named LeeAnn Tweeden revealed that Al Franken had \u201cforcibly kissed\u201d and groped her during a USO tour in 2006.\nThe following comes from an article in which Tweeden shared her story\u2026\nI couldn\u2019t believe it.\nHe groped me, without my consent, while I was asleep.\nI felt violated all over again.\nEmbarrassed.\nBelittled.\nHumiliated.\nHow dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it\u2019s funny?\nI told my husband everything that happened and showed him the picture.\nI wanted to shout my story to the world with a megaphone to anyone who would listen, but even as angry as I was, I was worried about the potential backlash and damage going public might have on my career as a broadcaster.\nBut that was then, this is now.\nI\u2019m no longer afraid.\nWhen the story initially broke, Franken rushed to issue an apology\u2026\n\u201cI certainly don\u2019t remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann,\u201d said Franken.\n\u201cAs to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn\u2019t.\nI shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d\nNeedless to say, many were completely unsatisfied with Franken\u2019s very weak statement.\nIn fact, some members of his own party said that his apology was entirely insufficient and are calling for Franken to be held accountable for his actions\u2026\nGuy Cecil, the former head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and now the boss of a leading Democratic super PAC, voiced his frustration with the inadequacy of Franken\u2019s apology on Twitter.\n\u201cThat was not an apology and was an insufficient response to serious allegations,\u201d Cecil tweeted.\n\u201cAl Franken must be held accountable if our party wants to live up to our commitment to women & girls.\u201d\nThis scandal has set off a feeding frenzy as Internet sleuths search for other incidents in which Franken has acted inappropriately.\nAnd of course, since we are talking about Al Franken, it wasn\u2019t exactly difficult to find material.\nFor example, a photo has surfaced of Franken grabbing Joy Behar in a very creepy manner.\nThe following comes from Breitbart\u2026\nAmid the emergence of a 2006 photo of Al Franken groping journalist and talk radio anchor Leeann Tweeden, a photo of the embattled Minnesota Senator appearing to grab comedian Joy Behar\u2019s breast has also resurfaced.\nFranken was a comedian before he ever entered the world of politics, and we understand that.\nBut just because he was a comedian does not mean that he gets to play by a different set of rules.\nThere appears to be an ongoing pattern of behavior, and Fox News has documented some of the other incidents that have come up in the past\u2026\nFranken, then a comedian, was quoted in a 1995 New York Magazine article discussing a skit for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d that involved drugging and raping CBS reporter Lesley Stahl.\nFranken, at the time a writer for \u201cSNL,\u201d suggested one skit should play out with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d commentator Andy Rooney finding an empty pill bottle on his desk.\n\u201c\u2019I give the pills to Lesley Stahl.\nThen when Lesley is passed out, I take her to the closet and rape her.\u2019 Or \u2018That\u2019s why you never see Lesley until February.\u2019 Or, \u2018When she passes out.\nI put her in various positions and take pictures of her,\u2019\u201d Franken was quoted saying.\nThe article, along with a 2000 Playboy column in which Franken talked about fantasizing a machine would perform oral sex on him, was used to attack Franken during his 2008 Senate campaign in Minnesota.\nAs much as we may be appalled by some of the things that Al Franken has done, the truth is that there are far worse offenders in Washington.\nLet\u2019s talk about Bill Clinton for a moment.\nDemocrats have been covering up his sexual crimes for years, and my hope is that now this will start to change.\nJuanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, Connie Hamzy, Eileen Wellstone, Sandra Allen James, Christy Zercher, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky, Gennifer Flowers, Elizabeth Ward Gracen, Sally Perdue, Lencola Sullivan, Susie Whitacre and Bobbie Ann William are some of the women that have made allegations against Clinton, and if even half of their allegations are true Clinton should be in prison for the rest of his life.\nIn my article yesterday, I discussed how one Secret Service agent is charging former Vice-President Joe Biden of engaging in \u201cWeinstein-level\u201d behavior, and I also talked about how 15 million dollars in settlements have been secretly paid out to victims of sexual harassment in the House of Representatives in recent years.\nThere is a culture of corruption in Washington D.C., and we desperately need to drain the swamp.\nIf you agree, I hope that you will support my campaign and the campaigns of other anti-establishment candidates that want to clean up the halls of Congress.\nIt is time to take our government back because at this point it has become an absolutely disgusting cesspool of filth and corruption.\nArticle posted with permission from End of the American Dream\n",

hospitals in the area over fears of needles and hospital treatment as a whole, according to a shocking report in The Sun newspaper.\nSecurity guards with at least one hospital have been tasked with forcefully keeping black death patients in the hospital as well as following the strict safety procedures set up in an attempt to quell the outbreak.\nThe Sun reported:\nOfficials at the hospital say the main reason why patients run away is that they are scared of needles and don\u2019t have much experience of hospitals.\nJean Benoit Manhes, the deputy representative of Unicef, told the Irish Times: \u201cSome escaped because they\u2019re afraid of needles.\nPeople here are not used to the hospital.\n\u201cThe problem of plague is not just a medical response.\nYou can have hospitals but if people don\u2019t come it isn\u2019t enough.\u201d Such incidents have prompted fears that the plague could spread even further with each confirmed case requiring 20 people have been in contact with to be treated as a precaution.\nMalagasy people have also been told not to carry out their traditional burial tradition of Famidihana which involves digging up their dead relatives every seven years.\nIt means \u2018turning the bones\u2019 and sees families cleaning the remains, rewrapping them and reburying them while other family members perform a special dance.\nThe African island\u2019s government has told citizens to pause the tradition for fear the plague bacteria is still active in the corpses and can be spread to the living.\nNews of infected patients running away from hospitals

plague that has sickened over 2000 people in Madagascar since August is impossible to eradicate.\nEven though the number of those infected has dropped in recent weeks, the plague will never truly be gone.\nSince the airborne version of the plague can kill a person in just three hours, experts warn that its too soon to think that since there hasn\u2019t been a person infected in recent days, that it won\u2019t pop up again.\nThat\u2019s because the bacteria that causes plague is now so widespread in wildlife, that humans can\u2019t do anything to get rid of it, said Dr. Allen Cheng, Professor of Infectious Diseases Epidemiology at Monash University in Melbourne.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not possible to eradicate plague, as it is widespread in wildlife rodents outside the sphere of human influence,\u201d Cheng wrote on The Conversation.\n\u201cOutbreaks, generally, are managed reactively by \u2018firefighting teams\u2019, deployed to clear houses of fleas, identify and treat cases and give pre-emptive treatment to contacts at risk.\nA more preventative approach, such as the identification of areas at risk using climate models and animal surveys to focus flea and rat control efforts, would be better,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut, this requires a better understanding of transmission pathways in each region where disease persists.\u201d\nThe best way to stop the plague spreading was to focus on flea and rat control in the most at-risk areas, he said.\nCheng\u2019s comments came after at least 171 people died in Madagascar over an outbreak of plague.\nNine countries were urged by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to prepare for a black death attack, at the end of October.\nIt\u2019s been reported that plague has been transmitted to humans by camels, goats, prairie dogs, rock squirrels and guinea pigs since the 1960\u2019s.\nThere are only a few remaining hotspots for plague in the world \u2013 Madagascar being one of them.\nThis outbreak was also highly

numbers, and they aren\u2019t pretty.\nReid Wilson, a correspondent for the Hill, has posted to Twitter a year by year breakdown of sexual harassment settlements and awards that he received from the Congressional Office of Compliance.\nI went ahead and added up each column, and what I discovered is that 264 cases of sexual harassment in Congress have been settled since 1997, and the total amount awarded in those settlements comes to a grand total of $17,250,854.\nSo where has the $17,250,854 come from to pay those settlements?\nThat money has come from the taxpayers of course.\nThat means that you and I have been paying to cover up the epidemic of sexual harassment that has been taking place on Capitol Hill.\nWhen U.S. Representative Jackie Speier originally told us that more than 15 million dollars had been paid out to victims of sexual harassment in recent years, I was envisioning a few dozen cases at most.\nI had no idea that the total number of cases would actually be well over 200.\nIf our leaders were serious about stopping this from happening, they would pass a law making it mandatory that all cases of sexual harassment in Congress be made public, and that members of Congress would be personally responsible for paying out any settlements.\nIf such a law was instituted, I guarantee you that sexual harassment on Capitol Hill would come to a screeching halt.\nBut they don\u2019t want it to stop.\nFor many in Congress, having so many attractive young women around is one of the key benefits of the job.\nI included the following quote from CNN in an article the

should be getting very nervous about the ongoing investigations into the Uranium One deal.\nWhat must be most annoying for the Clinton team is that these investigations all started as a way to undermine the Trump administration and continue to push connections between Trump and Russia.\nNow, more than a year after the investigations began, it\u2019s looking less likely than ever that President Trump did anything wrong\u2026 but the investigations seem to be zeroing in on key Clinton team members (including the Clintons themselves).\nOn Tuesday night Fox News Sean Hannity sat down to talk about the exploding scandal that is the Uranium One deal, and what it could mean for the Clinton family.\nHannity spoke with investigative reporter Sara Carter of Circa, John Solomon of The Hill, and Victoria Toensing, an attorney representing the FBI informant who allegedly possesses documents on the sale of Canadian mining company \u2018Uranium One\u2019 to Russia interests back in 2010.\nNow that the NDA (non disclosure agreement) has been lifted Circa\u2019s Sara Carter is \u201creporting that she has received a treasure trove of documents that in fact prove tonight the FBI informant has knowledge of Russia\u2019s involvement in uranium one.\u201d\nNot to be outdone, the Hill\u2019s John Solomon had found even more dirt on this ugly Clinton led deal.\nApparently, Solomon has learned that the FBI informant \u201chas evidence, was on the inside, directly from Putin\u2019s Russia, the push for nuclear fuel deals, and all the crimes we talked about, bribery, kickback, extortion, money laundering, racketeering, all knelt corroborating and will be corroborated even further.\nGo into your report.\u201d\nThis is all about to get very ugly.\nhttps://youtu.be/_DFeri21hlc\nHANNITY: Breaking news tonight, the Hills John Solomon, investigative reporter Sara Carter, they released bombshell reports equally tonight.\nSolomon reporting according to the memos obtained, the FBI informant that now has had his NDA lifted at the center of this case gathered years and years of evidence of Russia\u2019s plot to control U.S. Nuclear fuel, which included the uranium one deal.\nAnd Sara Carter reporting that she has received a treasure trove of documents that in fact prove tonight the FBI informant has knowledge of Russia\u2019s involvement in uranium one.\nAlso joining us now is the attorney for the FBI informant, Victoria Toensing along with John and Sara.\nSara, let\u2019s start with your report.\nA treasure trove, that is huge.\nSARAH CARTER, CIRCA NEWS: It is Sean.\nI mean there\u2019s over 5,000 documents which include emails, briefs, other documentation, memorandums that the informant had turned over to the FBI and Justice Department, and within these documents, it\u2019s very evident of Russia\u2019s intention to enter the American market, energy market.\nAnd their intentions to acquire uranium one.\nHANNITY: John, you go into extensive detail in a very long and hard-hitting piece tonight and revealing piece, how the FBI informant \u2014 you actually said six years, I thought he was only an informant for four years.\nHe has evidence, was on the inside, directly from Putin\u2019s Russia, the push for nuclear fuel deals, and all the crimes we talked about, bribery, kickback, extortion, money laundering, racketeering, all knelt corroborating and will be corroborated even further.\nGo into your report.\nJOHN SOLOMON, THE HILL: You know, Sara just said something about the importance of the dominance of the uranium market.\nThis is an email that the FBI has had for six years.\nIt shows that uranium one was part of a Russia strategy to control, not just benefit from the global market, controlled the global market.\nThat would put the United States at a disadvantage.\nThat is the sort of evidence that this FBI informant has right now.\nIf you go back on the last week we heard several things from the Justice Department, there\u2019s no connection to uranium one.\nThese are emails that say uranium one that are in the FBI files.\nThey said that there was no connection between the uranium one case and the criminal case.\nWe now know the criminal case got its first evidence in 2009, a whole year before the uranium one deal was approved by the Obama administration.\nThere are a lot of things that people have been saying that these documents simply don\u2019t agree with.\nHANNITY: All right.\nI got a very high ranking Congressman and that knows, let us put it that way, and actually sent me a note.\nThe knowledge of key administration officials will be the next thing proven by both of you, and the links to the Clinton foundation.\nSara, is that true?\nCARTER: I believe that is true.\nI mean especially when we at \u2014\nHANNITY: Do believe or you know?\nI can\u2019t ask Victoria that question because she won\u2019t tell me.\nCARTER: I know it\u2019s true.\nI know that looking at these documents following the money, following the money is what\u2019s important here.\nThe Justice Department has not pointed out that they will possibly call a special counsel to this.\nThis is still out there.\nThey are looking into it.\nThat is something that they need to decide.\nBut whether it\u2019s a special counsel or whether it\u2019s a prosecutor that is investigating this, they will be able to follow the money.\nThere are somethings said \u2026\nHANNITY: When you say follow the money, my suspicion would go to the money came directly from Russia, was funneled through the Canadian donors to the Clinton Foundation.\nHow good are my instincts?\nCARTER: You have pretty good instincts.\nI think there\u2019s a lot of other areas that they will be looking at as well.\nRemember this is like peeling back an onion.\nYou peel one part and then you find another part.\nAnd that is what\u2019s going to require somebody to do an extensive investigation.\nHANNITY: But it is beginning to cascade Sara.\nCARTER: It is.\nHANNITY: John, I want her to respond to the same thing, that the Clinton Foundation, that this will be traced back to high-ranking Obama administration officials and the Clinton Foundation, and if you add the money portion Sara mentioned?\nSOLOMON: I do.\nI think the place we will be talking about in the next couple weeks as the Clinton global initiative.\nSort of a side project of the Clinton Foundation.\nThere are new flows of money there that we will report on then the next couple of weeks.\nThere were also some personal business projects, some very senior Clinton people that got a remarkable infusion of cash from Russia.\nIt will be able to talk about that in the next couple of weeks.\nAnother layer of interest of the story.\nHANNITY: All right.\nWe have a lot of time in the segment so I want to go very slowly here.\nBoth of you, before I get to Victoria, Sara and John, you both in your pieces said 5,000 documents.\nI hear the number the FBI informant is much, much greater, tens of thousands.\nTrue or false?\nSOLOMON: That seems to be accurate.\nWe have a subset of the documents and they are very voluminous.\nHANNITY: Now let me go to Victoria.\nOne of the great attorneys.\nShe is the most difficult to get any information out of.\nVictoria, one of the things I\u2019ve known about you, and I\u2019ve interviewed you so many times over the years, you now have been doing a deep dive into all of this.\nYou are now representing this FBI informant.\nI think they will become an American hero out of all of this, but apparently, he was fighting and begging and pleading and saying the Russians are here, they are doing this, why are you paying attention?\nI hope my instincts are right there, and number two, how devastating it legally is this going to be based on what I was just asking Sara and John about impacting former Obama officials, money, Clinton foundation?\nVICTORIA TOENSING, ATTORNEY REPRESENTING FBI INFORMANT: Let me go to number one first, that is the whole essence of what John and Sara and I are talking about is that in 2009, 2010, our FBI and presumably our Justice Department, and the White House, as my client was told, all knew about this corruption in the Russian nuclear energy area.\nThere\u2019s no separate companies.\nThey are all related.\nThe Russian nuclear energy is controlled from the top, from Putin.\nThey are all one.\nThey all talk to each other.\nSo the evidence about this corruption was known to our government in 2009, 2010, and why is it that CFIUS either wasn\u2019t told, or CFIUS people knowing about it \u2014\nHANNITY: Explain CFIUS, 13 agencies, I am sorry 9 agencies approving the deal that gave control of uranium one to the bad actor, hostile regime, Putin Russia.\nTOENSING: They said, the CFIUS board said that the bad Russians could buy uranium one, which contains access to 20 percent of the U.S.\nUranium, why was that decision made?\nWas CFIUS told?\nDid Bob Mueller go to Eric Holder and tell him?\nEric Holder sat on it.\nHANNITY: He was one of the nine.\nTOENSING: Did Bob Mueller go to the White House and tell him?\nThe FBI agents told my client that they were briefing the President about his conduct.\nOf course, when the CFIUS decision was made.\nMy client said, what happened?\nHANNITY: Back to my original question, counselor, if I may.\nYou are too good at your job.\nThis is a very serious point.\nPutting your legal hat on, objectively speaking, yes they knew, the evidence will prove it based on the documents and your client, crimes committed on a high level?\nNational security compromise?\nTOENSING: Of course, it goes without saying giving the Russians control of the uranium was a national security compromise.\nI think that we are going to have to do is continue to follow the money because the reporting that John and Sara are going to be doing in a few days will be revealing about where lots of the various money went and where it came from.\nHANNITY: Always we go back, and I believe at the end of this you guys deserve a Pulitzer, and I\u2019m not the only one thinking that.\nYou have dug so deep on this, this has been a deep dive and I applaud you both.\nI want to ask as it relates to who knew what, and when.\nWhat did they know, when did they know it, John Solomon?\nI\u2019m talking about Obama, Mueller, Eric Holder, and Hillary Clinton.\nSOLOMON: We are at a little disadvantage right now, because we don\u2019t have those records, and also the records that Congress needs to go get, but I can tell you I have a person quoted in my story who has direct knowledge of what the Justice Department knew.\nThis person said without a shred of doubt, we knew in 2009 a year before CFIUS ruled that Thomas were engaged in criminality, without a shadow of a doubt, we knew that Russia was trying to gain a corner on the U.S. market, get a strong hold on our uranium, and without a doubt we knew they were using political levers to try to get their way here.\nWe are talking about control, like this document says, they are trying to gain control of our markets.\nThat has to be national security interest that should have been raised in CFIUS.\nHANNITY: President daily briefings were told.\nHad this information in it before CFIUS approves this.\nCARTER: Sean.\nThat is what we need to find out.\nWe need to see those Presidential daily briefings.\nCongress can get those.\nThey will be able to know whether or not President Obama was briefed on this and according to a number of people that I have spoken with as well, he was.\nI think that will reveal a whole other layer of who knew what, where and when.\nAnd we follow the money and it will reveal even more about Hillary Clinton and what she knew and when did she know it, and the other members of the CFIUS board.\nHANNITY: And Obama and Holder and Mueller?\nJohn, real quick, we are running out of time.\nSOLOMON: yes listen, I think even Sessions and Rosenstein have questions to answer.\nThere are people in Congress who don\u2019t think they\u2019ve gotten a straight answer from them.\nHANNITY: All right.\nVictoria, we get the last word from you, laws broken?\nTOENSING: Well, of course.\nHANNITY: You are so good at your job.\nYou are so annoyingly good.\nThe American people deserve the truth

distance of the moon.\nMuch closer flybys have occurred in the very recent past.\nScientists at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory are planning to use the opportunity to obtain a detailed 3D model of the asteroid, which has a particularly irregular shape.\nFirst detected in December 2007, 3200 Phaethon is widely thought to be the parent body for the Geminid meteor shower, which is due to peak this year on the night of December 13.\nThis would make the Geminids one of only two major meteor showers not originating from a comet; the other being the Quadrantids in January.\nThe main difference between asteroids and comets is their composition.\nAsteroids are made up of metals and rocky material, while comets are made up of ice, dust and rocky material.\nComets which approach the Sun lose material with each orbit because some of their ice melts and vaporizes to form a tail.\nBut the real question is will anyone be able to see the asteroid\u2019s close approach to our planet.\nAccording to NASA, 3200 Phaethon will be visible in small telescopes for experienced observers in areas with dark skies.\nIt is potentially detectable for three weeks but will be at its brightest between December 11 and 21.\nIf you don\u2019t see the asteroid itself, be sure to look out for the Geminid meteor shower, which is set to provide a spectacular show over the course of 10 nights in December,

could be forgiven for believing that prosecution and defense both got the outcome they wanted, regardless of the tragedy for the Steinle family.\nThe felony firearms charge, the only charge on which Garcia Zarate was found guilty, carries a sentence of 16 months to 3 years.\nSince Garcia Zarate has been languishing in jail, the authorities could commute any sentence to time served and he could walk free within weeks.\nSan Francisco is not likely to hand the felon over to ICE for deportation.\nShould that happen, Garcia Zarate has already proved five times that anybody can get away with

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 1, 2017\nUpdate 1: AP reports that U.S. immigration officials say they will deport the Mexican man found not guilty of murder in San Francisco pier shooting.\n* * *\nAs we detailed earlier, in a verdict that has shocked many in the Bay Area (and across America), a jury of six men and six women in sanctuary city San Francisco found illegal immigrant (and five-time deportee) Jose Ines Garcia Zarate not guilty in the death of Kate Steinle.\nMr. Garcia Zarate had been homeless at the time of the shooting and had multiple felony convictions and five prior deportations to Mexico.\nHe had been set free from jail only months before the shooting, in defiance of requests by federal immigration authorities, who had asked that he be held longer so he could be deported again.\nThe backlash to his release into the community crescendoed when Donald Trump invoked Ms. Steinle\u2019s killing as he campaigned for president.\nAs The New York Times reports, Ms. Steinle\u2019s death in July 2015 fed into a fierce debate over whether immigrants without legal status should be deported more aggressively, and over the role local law enforcement should play.\nMs. Steinle, known as Kate, a 32-year-old medical equipment saleswoman, was walking along Pier 14 in San Francisco when she was struck by a bullet and collapsed into her father\u2019s arms.\nMr. Garcia Zarate acknowledged firing the weapon, but said it was an accident.\nZarate and his defense team maintained the argument that the suspect found the stolen weapon on the pier that day and it \u201cjust fired.\u201d The gun belonged to a federal Bureau of Land Management ranger and was stolen from his parked car a week earlier.\nThe bullet ricocheted on the pier\u2019s concrete walkway before it struck Steinle, killing her.\nZarate has admitted to shooting Steinle, but says it was an accident.\nDefense attorney Matt Gonzalez said Garcia Zarate found the gun at the pier\u2026 but the stories of what happened copntradicted one another\u2026\nHe said it was wrapped in cloth, and when Garcia Zarate unwrapped it, the gun accidentally discharged.\nBut in a police interrogation, Garcia Zarate admitted to firing the gun, saying he was aiming at a seal.\nHe also told police that he stepped on the gun, causing it to fire.\nBut still, after six days of deliberation, the illegal Mexcian immigrant was acquitted of murder and manslaughter charges and also found not guilty of assault with a firearm.\nGarcia Zarate was found guilty of illegal firearms possession, which carries a sentence of 16 months to three years.\n* * *\nThe public defender wasted no time in focusing his thoughts on President Trump and his administration\u2026saying Zarate was \u201cextremely relieved\u201d by the outcome and that while Steinle\u2019s death \u201cwas a horrible tragedy,\u201d it was used as \u201cpolitical fodder for then candidate Donald Trump\u2019s anti-immigration agenda.\u201d\nAdachi added, \u201cDespite the unfairly politicized atmosphere surrounding this case, jurors focused on the evidence, which was clear and convincing, and rendered a just verdict.\u201d\nIn a response to the verdict, Attorney General Jeff Sessions released a statement saying that despite California\u2019s attempt at a murder conviction, Zarate was able to walk away with only a firearm possession conviction because he was not turned over by San Francisco to ICE.\n\u201cWhen jurisdictions choose to return criminal aliens to the streets rather than turning them over to federal immigration authorities, they put the public\u2019s safety at risk,\u201d the statement said.\n\u201cSan Francisco\u2019s decision to protect criminal aliens led to the preventable and heartbreaking death of Kate

the reviewing of those cases.\nAt issue is a large group of Indonesian Chinese Christians who fled a pogrom in Indonesia directed against them in the 1990s.\nThe Chinese generally filed asylum applications after arriving in the United States, and, importantly, not at an American embassy or consulate in Indonesia or nearby.\nAll were relatively wealthy and had or obtained tourist visas to the United States.\nThis is important as most actual \"refugees\" drop everything to flee their homelands if they are under threat of death.\nTellingly, these asylum applicants were the elite of Indonesian society, because their higher average IQ, than the rather dull Indonesians.\n87 is the average Indonesian IQ , and note that average includes the higher average Chinese, so the locals really are a dull lot.\nThis is important in that while there was anti-Chinese and anti-Christian violence, the non-Chinese Christians mostly stuck around, though the Chinese used tourist and student visas to come to the United States in a leisurely manner, taking time to either bring or otherwise secure their wealth in Indonesia.\nIn any event, the persecution was limited in time and duration as the local elite know they need the Chinese to run the economy and to avoid Red China intervening on behalf of their fellow ethnics.\nIn the United States, these Chinese went through the liberal asylum process, but did not manage to fool even the credulous \"judges\" at the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the immigration courts.\nFast forward to the Obama Regime Administrative Amnesty , where despite outstanding deportation orders, these illegal aliens, among millions of others, are allowed to remain, and then given employment authorization as well.\nFortunately, elections have consequences, and the Obama Regime Administrative Amnesty, or parts of it, came to an inglorious end.\nAnd end it was for this particular lot of illegal aliens.\nBut Kritarch Patti Saris was having none of the immigration laws of the United States.\nShe thought she was decider-in-chief on who gets deported.\nAnd all on the flimsy excuse that the aliens need another bite at the apple, despite the clear fact that the Indonesian government had long ago quashed the ethnic riots directed against the market dominant minority of Chinese and the religious motivated violence against Christians.\nWhile there are a couple of provinces in Indonesia that impose Sharia law on Muslims, most non-Muslims are exempt.\nAs moderates go, Indonesia is about as close as it gets to moderate Muslims.\nMostly because the country would not last long without an outside high IQ elite to run the country.\nBefore it was the high IQ Dutch, now it's the Chinese.\nRemember, an 87 IQ is just about retarded.\nA federal judge on Monday ordered U.S. immigration officials to delay any efforts to deport 51 Indonesians living illegally in New Hampshire so the group can have time to argue that changing conditions in that country would make it dangerous to return... Federal law gives authority over immigration matters to the executive branch, not the courts.\nChief U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston found she had authority to ensure the Indonesians have a chance to argue that conditions in their home country had deteriorated significantly enough to reopen their cases for trying to stay in the United State.\nShe worried that without the order, ICE officials could deport some of the Indonesians covered by the suit, at which time they would lose the opportunity to have their cases reopened.\n[Judge Orders U.S. To Delay Deporting Indonesians In Immigration Fight, by Scott Malone, Reuters, November 27, 2017]\nKritarch Saris thought she knew better and has been running a deliberate campaign to prevent the deportation of these Chinese illegal aliens.\nAnd now she has gone full rogue, prohibiting the deportation of all these illegal aliens who already had their day in immigration court.Saris appears to be making up immigration law and procedure on the fly, as her order appears to not understand either the EOIR process or immigration law.\n\u201cThe government shall inform the court whether petitioners, who are not detained, will have access to emergency procedures if they must file their original motions to reopen,\u201d Saris wrote.\nThis makes no sense in English, much less in the established procedures in the EOIR.\nThe aliens have no emergency, there are no emergency procedures, and their original motions to reopen were denied for lack of legal basis in law or any changed conditions in the country they are being deported to that would avail them of another claim.\nIndonesia is more hospitable to Chinese Christians today than the short period in the 90s when there was a problem.\nBut basically, Saris wants the illegal aliens the opportunity to submit another asylum application, and benefit by the years it will take to adjudicate those claims.\nBasically Saris wants these illegals to never leave.\nThat, of course is not her role.\nThe only claim they have before a Federal court is if they got the due process that Congress gave those illegal aliens.\nAnd they did, they filed for asylum, had a hearing and appeals, and lost.\nWith the legislative fight over DACA, the Trump Administration needs to include legislative language including more restrictions on kritarchs who want to make American immigration policy, as well as other reforms to lower legal immigration, build the wall, and deport illegals here.\nOr impeachment, or both.\n", ["Repetition", "Exaggeration,Minimisation", "Loaded_Language",

(AAS)\u2014the Vatican's organ for promulgating the Official Acts of the Apostolic See\u2014published Pope Francis' October 2016 letter to the bishops of Buenos Aires in which he praised their episcopal guidelines allowing divorced and civilly remarried Catholics to receive Holy Communion in some cases while living in a state of objective mortal sin.\nIf papal clarification was ever needed on the long-debated issue of the intended meaning of Amoris Laetitia chapter VIII, such clarification has now been provided for the Church at large.\nConcerning these guidelines that allow \"the possibility of access to the sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist\" in \"complex circumstances\" where \"limitations that lessen the responsibility and guilt\" permit adulterous couples to continue in adultery, the pope said in his letter:\n\"The document is very good and completely explains the meaning of chapter VIII of Amoris Laetitia.\nThere are no other interpretations.\"\nUntil now, the pope's letter to the Argentinian bishops had been considered a private letter with no binding force, whereas AAS has now elevated Pope Francis' letter to the official magisterial status of an \"Apostolic Letter,\" while including a special rescript as an addendum by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Secretary of State.\nThe rescript declares that Pope Francis expressly intends both documents\u2014the papal letter and the episcopal guidelines\u2014to bear the character of his \"authentic Magisterium,\" and that the pope has personally ordered their publication in AAS and on the Vatican website.\nHence Amoris Laetitia VIII, which proposes that people living in adultery can be guiltless and thus be admitted to the sacraments of Confession and Communion when \"concrete circumstances\" make it difficult to renounce their adulterous state, is now declared \"magisterial\" by the Holy See.\nThe problem with this is that heresy or sacrilege can never be declared magisterial, so that if it is, it not only has no binding force, but the faithful are obliged to resist and refute such a declaration.\nSt. Thomas Aquinas says in his Summa Theologiae: \"If the faith were endangered, a subject ought to rebuke his prelate [pope] even publicly.\"\nThe fact is that this latest promulgation is counter-magisterial, but the pope and his right-hand man now feel they have enough support from the dissenting left that enables them to come forward with it.\nCardinal Parolin's rescript on the papal and episcopal documents reads as follows:\nRescript \"from an Audience with His Holiness\"\nThe Supreme Pontiff decreed that the two preceding documents be promulgated through publication on the Vatican website and in Acta Apostolicae Sedis, as authentic Magisterium.\nFrom the Vatican Palace, on the day of June 5 in the year 2017\nPietro Card.\nParolin\nSecretary of State\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia defines a papal rescript as follows: \"Rescripts are responses of the pope or a Sacred Congregation, in writing, to queries or petitions of individuals.\nSome rescripts concern the granting of favors; others the administration of justice, e.g.\nthe interpretation of a law.\"\nIt appears then that Parolin's rescript constitutes a direct reply to the dubia of the Four Cardinals.\nPope Francis' praise of the episcopal guidelines clearly answers the cardinals' query concerning his intention in Amoris Laetitia VIII, so will Cardinals Brandmuller and Burke now proceed to issue the formal correction of it?\nAs reported in The Dictator Pope\u2014a remarkable new book which provides an inside look at the most tyrannical and unprincipled papacy of recent history\u2014English Cardinal Cormac Murphy O\u2019Connor who was largely responsible for the vote canvassing behind Francis' election told journalist Paul Valley in 2013, \"Four years of Bergoglio would be enough to change things.\"\nEach day, we see new evidence that this might have been a gross understatement.\nWe shouldn't rule out the possibility that Francis may come forward one day and declare \"ex-cathedra\" that the interpretation of Amoris Laetitia VIII, as now taught by the Holy See, is promulgated as \"extraordinary magisterium.\"\nShould this happen, the Mystical Body would then be without its head.\nIn an interview with Catholic World Report (CWR) in December 2016, Cardinal Raymond Burke, who is presently a member of the Apostolic Signatura, said that if a pope were to \"formally profess heresy he would cease, by that act, to be the Pope.\"\nBurke was reiterating Church teaching, as expressed by famed canonist Franz Wernz in his Ius Canonicum: \"In sum, it needs to be said clearly that a [publicly] heretical Roman Pontiff loses his power upon the very fact.\"\n", ["Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority"]], ["San Francisco Show Trial Sequel\nLast week, a San Francisco jury acquitted seven-time felon Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, a repeatedly deported Mexican national, of all murder and manslaughter charges in the July 1, 2015, fatal shooting of Kate Steinle as she walked with her father and a friend on Pier 14.\nThe jury found the confessed shooter guilty only of felony gun possession.\nMany observers decried the verdict as a travesty of justice, but they were mistaken if they thought it could not get any worse.\nSan Francisco public defender Matt Gonzalez now seeks to have Zarate\u2019s gun possession charge dismissed.\nGonzalez is contending the jury should have been told that \u201cmomentary\u201d possession of a gun is not necessarily a crime.\n\u201cIf you possess it just to dispose of it or abandon it, it wouldn\u2019t be a crime,\u201d Gonzalez told reporters.\nThe Steinle family and relatives of murder victims have new cause for outrage, but this gambit is consistent with Gonzalez and the San Francisco show-trial in which he co-starred.\nGonzalez hails from McAllen, Texas, and attended Columbia University on a scholarship.\nAs he explained, \u201cI think I was a product of affirmative action,\u201d and ethnic preferences doubtless played a role in admission to Stanford Law School.\nIn San Francisco, Gonzalez became known as \u201cThe Great Left Hope,\u201d and a hero to Bay Area radicals.\nThe La Raza Lawyers Association named Gonzalez Lawyer of the Year, and the Mexican American Political Association, a group with roots in the Communist Party, gave him the Bert Corona award, after one of the CPUSA\u2019s most high-profile Stalinists.\nIn 2,000, after a decade as a public defender, Gonzalez gained election to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.\nIn 2003, as board president, he commissioned a graffiti artist to spray SMASH THE STATE on his office wall, in \u201ctraffic cone orange.\u201d As Gonzalez explained, \u201cThis is a sentiment I think all of us have had.\nYou have to rally and find ways of opposing what you don\u2019t like.\u201d\nIn 2003 Gonzalez ran for mayor of San Francisco but lost to Gavin Newsom.\nIn 2008 Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader tapped Gonzalez for vice president.\n\u201cHe has a great, steadfast commitment to justice,\u201d Nader told reporters.\nOn that score, the Steinle family and other relatives of murder victims have room for reasonable doubt.\nIn jury selection, Gonzalez and the prosecutor, assistant district attorney Diana Garcia, included three \u201cimmigrants,\u201d quite possibly false-documented illegals.\nTrue to form, judge Samuel Feng sealed the identities of the jurors.\nSo observers have grounds to believe that Garcia and Gonzalez both got the jury they wanted.\nGarcia told the court Zarate was playing his own \u201csecret version of Russian roulette,\u201d and thus parroted the defense\u2019s contention that the shooting was all a matter of chance.\nAs it happens, in Russian roulette a shooter loads one bullet into a six-shot revolver, spins the cylinder, then puts the gun to his own head and pulls the trigger.\nIn a central fact of the case, Zarate did not aim the gun at himself but fired in the direction of Kate Steinle.\nIn another established fact, the bullet struck her in the lower back and tore through her abdominal aorta.\nThis happened in broad daylight, but as in In the Heat of the Night, they had the body which was dead.\nGarcia Zarate confessed to firing the shot and had gunpowder residue on his hands.\nAfter firing, he tossed the gun in the water.\nHe said he had found the stolen weapon wrapped in a cloth and that it discharged by itself, both utterly unbelievable claims.\nEven so, the politically correct jury found the career criminal not guilty of murder and manslaughter.\nAny observer could be forgiven for believing that prosecution and defense both got the outcome they wanted.\nUnlike Stalin\u2019s trials of the old Bolsheviks, and Fidel Castro\u2019 trial of General Arnaldo Ochoa, this show trial aimed to establish innocence for the guilty, and the dynamics of the left were on full display.\nDenunciations of \u201cgun violence\u201d were nowhere in evidence and expressions of sympathy for the Steinle family proved pathetically weak.\nAs Arthur Koestler said, on the left the truth is spoken with loathing and falsehood with love.\nOn the left, as Orwell had it in Animal Farm, rats are comrades, and criminals are victims of capitalist society.\nIn the view of Gonzalez, society is progressing toward a social justice paradise ruled by a wise elite that knows what\u2019s best for all.\nIn this inexorable progress, determined by history, some people are going to have to die.\nAs Bertolt Brecht told Sidney Hook about Stalin\u2019s victims, \u201cthe more innocent they are, the more they deserve to be shot.\u201d\nOut for a summer-day walk with her father and a friend, Kate Steinle was a completely innocent victim, gunned down by a career criminal who was not even supposed to be in the country but found special protection in the sanctuary city of San Francisco, part of the sanctuary state of California.\nAs defense attorney Francisco Ugarte said, the verdict was a \u201cvindication for the rights of immigrants.\u201d\nSince Donald Trump mentioned the case, former vice-presidential candidate Matt Gonzalez had to establish the complete innocence of the shooter.\nThat explains the effort of \u201cThe Great Left Hope\u201d to have his client\u2019s felony gun possession conviction tossed.\nAny observer of the case could believe it probably will be.\n", ["Exaggeration,Minimisation",

incontrovertible, and cannot help but clarify who Francis is and what he\u2019s about.\u201d And the picture that emerges in stark relief in The Dictator Pope, as Life Site News reports , is that of \u201ca power-hungry, manipulative dictator, [who] celebrated the abdication of Benedict XVI\u201d because he knew what it meant: that the plan to give him the Keys of Peter in 2005 would finally come to fruition in 2013.\n\u201cWe elected you to make reforms, not to smash everything!\u201d Thus is Cardinal Leonardi Sandri, a fellow Argentinian and a supporter of Pope Francis at the conclave of 2013, reliably reported literally to have screamed at Pope Francis behind closed doors in the Vatican.\nSandri would be one of a number of Bergoglian partisans at the conclave who are now said to be experiencing \u201cbuyer\u2019s remorse,\u201d as documented most recently in the explosive best-seller The Dictator Pope .\n\"When the shepherd becomes a wolf, the first duty of the flock is to defend itself.\nThe true children of Holy Church, at such times, are those who walk by the light of their Baptism, not the cowardly souls who, under the specious pretext of submission to the powers that be, delay their opposition to the enemy in the hope of receiving instructions which are neither necessary nor desirable.\"\nFrancis, writes Royal, \u201chas little use for established procedures, precedents, even legal structures within the Church\u2026.\nWhen the head of the Church himself does not much feel bound by the tradition or impartial laws he has inherited, what then?\u201d What then indeed?\nThe Dictator Pope even feels at liberty to demand that the Lord\u2019s Prayer be changed to reflect his dissatisfaction with God\u2019s words: \u201cAnd lead us not into temptation [et ne nos inducas in tentationem],\u201d which Francis has decided, after 2,000 years, is a \u201cnot a good translation.\u201d Apparently lost on Francis, given the disordered m\u00e9lange of bits and pieces of things he has read that constitutes his theology, is the distinction between sin, a culpable act, and temptation, which arises from concupiscence or what Saint Thomas called the fomes, or the fleshly inclination to sin, which grace enables us to control by the rule of reason over the passions.\nBut now we are witness to the single worst act of tyranny in the entire history of the papacy.\nThe Church has seen a number of Popes who have abused their power, Alexander VI being the most popularly known example.\nBut never, before Francis, has there been a Pope who dared to tyrannize the Magisterium itself by attempting to bend it to his errant personal opinions.\nBy publication in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS), Francis has officially declared that the \u201cauthentic Magisterium\u201d includes the guidelines of the bishops of Buenos Aires for the implementation of Chapter 8 of Amoris Laetitia (AL), which he expressly approved in his letter to them as the only correct interpretation of his will.\nThe guidelines have been published in the AAS along with Francis\u2019s private missive, which is suddenly declared to be \u201can apostolic letter.\u201d\nThe normalist narrative has just been stripped of any colorable argument that nothing is too terribly amiss with this pontificate.\nWe are now expected to believe that the \u201cauthentic Magisterium\u201d\u2014meaning simply and only AL\u2014teaches what the guidelines preposterously declare, solely in reliance on AL:\nWhen the concrete circumstances of a couple make it feasible, especially when both are Christians with a journey of faith, one may propose that they commit to living in continence\u2026.\nIn other more complex circumstances, and when it is not possible to obtain a declaration of nullity, the aforementioned option may not, in fact, be viable.\nNonetheless, it is equally possible to undertake a journey of discernment\u2026.\n[I]f one arrives at the recognition that, in a concrete case, there are limitations that diminish responsibility and culpability (cf.\n301-302), particularly when a person judges that he would fall into a subsequent fault by damaging the children of the new union, Amoris Laetitia opens up the possibility of access to the Sacraments of Reconciliation and the Eucharist (cf.\nnotes 336 and 351).\nAs Francis would have it, then, the \u201cauthentic Magisterium\u201d has just flatly contradicted itself for the first time in two millennia:\nThe admission of public adulterers in \u201csecond marriages\u201d to Holy Communion, which John Paul II, in line with all of Tradition, called \u201c intrinsically impossible \u201d given their objective state in life, is now deemed possible depending on circumstances\u2014that is, situation ethics applied to violations of the Sixth Commandment.\nThe requirement that people embroiled in such unions commit to living in continence before they can be absolved and partake of the Blessed Sacrament\u2014a moral norm binding \u201c without exception \u201d because it is rooted in divine law\u2014is suddenly demoted to a mere \u201cproposal\u201d that may not be \u201cfeasible\u201d or \u201cviable\u201d in \u201cthe concrete circumstances of the couple.\u201d\nA valid annulment of a truly invalid marriage, the sine qua non for entering into marital relations with another purported spouse, is now dispensed with in \u201cmore complex circumstances\u2026 when it is not possible to obtain a declaration of nullity,\u201d the way thus being opened to de facto divorce in the Catholic Church.\nThe meaningless slogan \u201cjourney of discernment\u201d cloaks a naked authorization for the official toleration of adulterous sexual relations in the Church\u2019s sacramental life.\nNo less than a Roman Pontiff lends his name to the outrageous claim that children resulting from an adulterous relationship, blithely referred to as a \u201cnew union,\u201d could be \u201cdamaged\u201d if the partners in adultery were required to cease their adultery in order to be absolved and receive Holy Communion\u2014evidently because the \u201cnew union\u201d would dissolve without adulterous sexual relations and there could be a second divorce!\nThis appeared in the last Print-Edition of The Remnant.\nSee what else you missed.\nSubscribe Today!\nAs recently as seventeen years ago, during the reign of John Paul II, the Pontifical Council for the Interpretation of Legislative texts reaffirmed the immutable truth reflected in Canon 915, which prohibits the administration of Holy Communion to those \u201cwho obstinately persist in manifest grave sin.\u201d That prohibition, declared the Pontifical Council, applies to the divorced and \u201cremarried\u201d not as a matter of mere disciplinary law subject to revocation or modification, but rather \u201cis derived from divine law and transcends the domain of positive ecclesiastical laws; [and] the latter cannot introduce legislative changes which would oppose the doctrine of the Church.\u201d\nFrancis, however, has purported to do nothing less invent exceptions to divine law that oppose the doctrine of the Church.\nThe attempt is void, of course, and the appellation \u201cauthentic Magisterium\u201d is fraudulent.\nBut the consequences of this Pope\u2019s toying with the teaching office of the Church to advance half-baked theological notions, such as \u201cdiscernment\u201d (a term he borrows from St. Ignatius of Loyola but strips of its original meaning) are catastrophic.\nOver the past year, Cardinal Burke and a few other members of the hierarchy have called upon Francis to \u201cclarify\u201d his intention respecting AL.\nThat clarification has now been given: Francis intends, if it were possible, to change the unchangeable teaching of the Church regarding an irrevocable moral norm rooted in divine law.\nEven if the attempt is void and of no effect before man and God\u2014an immoral law is no law at all\u2014Francis clearly means to impose his will by fiat, daring invoke the \u201cauthentic Magisterium\u201d to cloak his absurd novelties.\nNo Pope before him has ever dared to do such a thing.\nSo now it must be asked: Where are the cardinals and the bishops?\nWith one or two noble (however inconsistent) exceptions, their response to the Bergoglian Debacle thus far ranges from silence, to active complicity, to\u2014at best\u2014hand-wringing over the increasingly chaotic state of the Church while begging the Pope to \u201cclarify\u201d his already perfectly clear intentions.\nAt this point, continued pleading for a Bergoglian \u201cclarification\u201d can only give rise to an impression of disingenuousness, whereas continued silence about the papal origin of this ongoing catastrophe is a standing rebuke to all the hierarchs who know what we all know: that at the epicenter of the chaos is the most wayward Pope the Church has ever had to endure.\nContinued inaction while the laity and a few good priests are left to themselves to defend, as best they can, the constant teaching of the Church against the abuses of a tyrant on the Chair of Peter threatens the hierarchs with a legacy of shame and a terrible accountability before the Just Judge.\nTheir failure to defend the Faith by standing up to the one they know full well is attacking it almost daily lends itself ever more to an indictment for timidity in the face of unprecedented danger to the Church and the cause of the Gospel of which they are divinely charged to be leaders.\nThe time for \u201cprudence\u201d is long past.\nPrudence now gives way to mere pusillanimity.\nThe time for hierarchical action is now, before the damage to the Church becomes irreparable.\nThe members of a hierarchy seemingly cowed by a papal tyranny the Church has never before seen must rise immediately and give a courageous answer to the challenge posed long ago by Monsignor Klaus Gamber, when an already monumental ecclesial crisis was still in what can now can be seen as merely a preliminary stage:\nWhere in our Church are the leaders who can show us the right path?\nWhere are the bishops courageous enough to cut out the cancerous growth of modernist theology that has implanted itself and is festering within the celebration of even the most sacred mysteries, before the cancer spreads and causes even greater damage?\nWhat we need today is a new Athanasius, a new Basil, bishops like those who in the fourth century fought courageously against Arianism when almost the whole of Christendom had succumbed to heresy.\nWill none of the hierarchs rise to defend the Church as \u201ca new Athanasius, a new Basil\u201d?\nEven the best among them continue to limit themselves to generalized lamentations at conferences or in interviews about the parlous state of the Church or at most the \u201cconfusion\u201d Francis has caused by not \u201cclarifying\u201d precisely what he has just clarified.\nThey avoid the absolutely necessary direct and public exposure of error at its source.\nThat error threatens to overwhelm the Church while they do little more than fret about a situation whose self-evident cause\u2014a reckless Pope in love with his own ideas and filled with contempt for Tradition\u2014they seem incapable of identifying.\nConcerned clergy and laity throughout the Catholic world are doing what they can according to their stations.\nBut in the midst of that \u201cfinal battle\u201d over marriage and family of which Sister Lucia warned the late Cardinal Caffarra in light of the Third Secret of Fatima, within the human element of the Church only the cardinals and the bishops possess the divinely bestowed power to repel an assault on marriage, family and the very integrity of the Faith that is now, for the first time in Church history, being led by a Roman Pontiff.\nThis undeniably apocalyptic development imposes upon the hierarchs\u2014first and foremost in the Church\u2014the duty to act.\nTrue love for the Church, indeed true charity toward Francis himself, requires of them nothing less than what was required of Saint Paul when the first Pope fell into error that jeopardized the very mission of the Church: that Peter be withstood to his face (Gal.\n2:11).\nMay Our Lady of Fatima intercede to obtain for them the grace of fortitude to do what must be done and what only they can do.\nOur hopes and prayers are with them as the foremost instruments of divine providence in the

of being official teachings of the church.\nWhile the content of the pope\u2019s letter itself does not contain teachings on faith and morals, it does point toward the interpretations of the Argentine bishops and confirms them as authentically reflecting his own mind.\nThus together the two documents became the Holy Father\u2019s authentic magisterium for the whole church.\u201d\nWhat Cardinal Burke rightly describes as lacking in any magisterial weight whatsoever\u2014and, in fact, in dire need of clarification and correction\u2014 has by papal fiat been declared magisterial, and thus

VIII of \u2018Amoris Laetitia.\u2019 There are no other interpretations.\u201d\nI would imagine this outrageous overreach of papal authority on the Pope's part would make it ominously clear to

the country both before and after taking office.\nHowever, Trump\u2019s anti-Iran strategy goes against the better judgment of even the most anti-Iranian advisors in his staff who don\u2019t want to see the U.S. isolated on the world stage.\nFortunately for Trump, however, he is not alone in his bid to isolate and demonize Iran at all costs.\nOn December 12, Trump\u2019s ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, gave a grandiose speech demonizing Iran that echoed Colin Powell\u2019s infamous performance before the U.N. in 2003.\nHaley\u2019s essential claim was that Saudi Arabia is under attack by missiles supplied to Yemen by the Iranian government and that the world should not sit idly by as this goes on.\n\u201cIf we do nothing about the missiles fired at Saudi Arabia, we will not be able to stop the violence,\u201d Haley warned.\n\u201cThere is clear evidence that the missiles that landed on Saudi Arabia come from Iran,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe evidence is undeniable.\nThe weapons might as well have had \u2018Made in Iran\u2019 stickers all over it.\u201d\nBuy Gold at Discounted Prices\nHowever, even as Haley opened her mouth, many commentators could already identify a number of issues with her speech.\nAs Common Dream\u2019s Reza Marashi explained:\n\u201cHaley cited a UN report in her claim regarding Iranian missile transfers to the Houthis.\nOf course, the UN has reached no such conclusion.\nInstead, a panel of experts concluded that fired missile fragments show components from an Iranian company, but they have \u2018no evidence as to the identity of the broker or supplier.\u2019 Asked about Haley\u2019s claim that Iran is the culprit, Sweden\u2019s ambassador to the UN said, \u2018The info I have is less clear.\u2019 Analysts from the U.S. Department of Defense speaking to reporters at Haley\u2019s speech openly acknowledged that they do not know the missiles\u2019 origin.\nPerhaps most surreal is the very same UN report cited by Haley also says the missile included a component that was manufactured by an American company.\nDid she disingenuously omit that inconvenient bit from her remarks, or fail to read the entire UN report?\nThe world may never know.\u201d\nRegardless of the fact that Haley misrepresented the U.N. report in question, it appears the entire premise of the U.N. report is almost completely incorrect, anyway, according to former inspector Scott Ritter.\nRitter writes:\n\u201cThe missile debris in question actually contradicts the finding of the UN panel, which held that the missiles launched against Saudi Arabia had been transferred to Yemen in pieces and assembled there by Houthi missile engineers; it is clear that the missiles in question had been in the possession of Yemen well before the Saudi Arabian-led intervention of 2015, and that their source was either Soviet or North Korean.\nThe modification kits, on the other hand, appear to be of Iranian origin, and were transported to Yemen via Oman.\nThe UN panel claims not to have any evidence of \u2018external missile specialists\u2019 working alongside the Houthi; indeed, the simplicity of the Burkhan 2-H modification concept is such that anyone already familiar with the SCUD-B missile system would be able to implement the required processes without outside assistance.\u201d [emphasis added]\nSo where did the missiles come from, and who made them?\nAccording to Ritter:\n\u201cRather than the Iranian-manufactured Qiam-1 missiles Haley and the Saudi Arabian government claimed, the debris presented by Haley were of a modified Soviet-manufactured SCUD-B missile; the airframe and engine are original Soviet-made components, and many of the smaller parts on display bear Cyrillic (i.e., Russian) markings.\nThe transformation to the Burkhan 2-H design required the Houthi engineers to increase the size of the fuel and oxidizer tanks, and lengthen the airframe accordingly.\nThis is done by cutting the airframe, and welding in place the appropriate segments (this also required that the fuel supply pipe, which passes through the oxidizer tank, be similarly lengthened.)\nThe difference in quality between the factory welds and the new welds is readily discernable.\nThe increased fuel supply permits a longer engine burn, which in turn increases the range of the missile.\nThe Burkhan 2-H uses a smaller warhead than the SCUD B; as such, the guidance and control section had been reconfigured to a smaller diameter, and an inter-stage section added to connect the warhead/guidance section with the main airframe.\u201d\n\ufeff\nThose who have been paying attention to this conflict have been well aware that the U.S. has had little material evidence to link Yemen\u2019s Houthis to Iranian arms suppliers.\nIn January of this year, a panel of U.N. experts stated:\n\u201cThe panel has not seen sufficient evidence to confirm any direct large-scale supply of arms from the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, although there are indicators that anti-tank guided weapons being supplied to the Houthi or Saleh forces are of Iranian manufacture.\u201d [emphasis added]\nEven if Iran were arming the Houthis, Haley\u2019s hypocritical anti-Iran rhetoric doesn\u2019t excuse the U.S. for continuing a foreign policy that essentially armed ISIS through U.S. weapons transfers, or for arming al-Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Syria, just to name two examples of Washington\u2019s schizophrenic approach to the region.\nWhy is the U.S. singling out Iran, especially when the Houthi rebels are sworn enemies of al-Qaeda?\nThe issues here go much deeper than nonsensical hypocrisy.\nAccording to Ritter, the entire debacle has shown that if Saudi Arabia cannot contain the Houthi\u2019s missile capabilities, it cannot possibly hope to take on Iran, which possesses a significantly more advanced military than the Houthis do on their own.\nRitter explains further:\n\u201cIf a relatively unsophisticated foe such as the Houthi, using Iranian-modified Soviet and North Korean missiles derived from 40-year-old technology, can evade an enemy force using the most modern combat aircraft backed up by the most sophisticated intelligence gathering systems available, and successfully launch ballistic missiles that threaten the political and economic infrastructure of the targeted state, what does that say about the prospects of any U.S.-led coalition taking on the far more advanced mobile missile threats that exist in North Korea and Iran today?\nThe fact of the matter is that no military anywhere has shown the ability to successfully interdict in any meaningful way a determined opponent armed with mobile ballistic missile capability.\nIf the Saudi experience in Yemen is to teach us anything, it is that any military plan designed to confront nations such as North Korea, Iran and Russia that are armed with sophisticated mobile ballistic missiles had better count on those capabilities remaining intact throughout any anticipated period of hostility.\nNo amount of chest-thumping and empty rhetoric by American political and/or military leaders can offset this harsh reality.\nThis is the critical lesson of Yemen, and the United States would do well to heed it before it tries to foment a crisis based upon trumped-up charges.\u201d [emphasis added]\n",

imaginary Catholic Pharisees who defend the Church\u2019s teaching on the indissolubility of marriage and the integrally related Eucharistic discipline\u2014he is still at it as of yesterday (January 9)\u2014he and his collaborators are busily engineering neo-Pharisaical escape hatches from the negative precepts of the divine and natural law emanating from the Sixth Commandment.\nDetermined to quell any Catholic opposition to his moral subversion, Francis has slapped the label Authentic Magisterium\u00ae on his outrageous opinion that in \u201ccomplex circumstances\u201d wherein it is not \u201cfeasible\u201d to live as brother and sister, two people who are not married can be admitted to Holy Communion without ceasing extra-marital sexual relations so long as they engage in an ill-defined \u201cprocess of discernment.\u201d As Father Brian Harrison has so trenchantly observed, this means that people embroiled in adultery can receive Holy Communion while they \u201cdiscern\u201d that they should not be receiving Holy Communion because they are embroiled in adultery.\nDo they think we are fools?\nThen there is the endlessly double-talking Cardinal M\u00fcller.\nIn a recent interview concerning Rocco Buttiglione\u2019s verbal contortions aimed at demonstrating that the administration of Holy Communion to public adulterers is consistent with the Church\u2019s bimillenial prohibition of precisely that, M\u00fcller proposed this preposterous \u201csolution\u201d to a \u201cproblem\u201d that does not exist:\nIt is possible that the penitent may be convinced in conscience, and with good reasons, of the invalidity of the first marriage even though they cannot offer canonical proof.\nIn this case the marriage valid before God would be the second one and the pastor could grant the sacrament, certainly with the appropriate precautions as not to scandalize the community of the faithful and not to weaken the conviction of marriage indissolubility.\nThe Cardinal knows this is moral and canonical nonsense.\nNo Catholic, whether or not he consults a priest, can declare for himself that his marriage in the Church was invalid, especially when\u2014indeed because\u2014he lacks canonical proof of invalidity.\nMoreover, absent an annulment granted by the competent Church tribunal, a purported \u201csecond marriage\u201d can only be an invalid civil ceremony and thus a thinly disguised form of continuous public adultery.\nCardinal Burke, whom Francis sacked as head of the Church\u2019s highest tribunal because he was a major impediment to the conspiracy culminating in Amoris Laetitia (AL), has observed the obvious in this regard:\nSuch cases do not exist.\nNo priest has the authority to declare a marriage null in the internal forum.\nMarriage is a public state in the Church, and the judgment regarding an accusation of nullity of marriage must be made in accord with the long practice of the Church.\nIf a college of judges in a matrimonial tribunal is not able to arrive at moral certitude regarding the nullity of a marriage after a careful and thorough examination of the petition of nullity, how can an individual priest be capable of making such a judgment having to do with the eternal salvation of the soul in question?\nThe only case in which a priest could admit a person living in an irregular matrimonial union to receive the Sacraments of Penance and Holy Eucharist is the case of a couple who agree to live \u201cas brother and sister\u201d, that is to respect the marriage to which they are bound by not living in a marital way with another person.\nEven then, the priest would have to insist that the couple living in continence receive the Sacraments in a place in which they are not well known, lest other faithful be led to believe that persons living in an irregular matrimonial union may receive the Sacraments.\nDoes Cardinal M\u00fcller think we are fools?\nSome of us apparently are, or at least are willing to serve as knowing dupes by defending neo-Pharisaical sophistry that would produce \u201ca discipline alien to the entire Tradition of the Catholic and Apostolic faith.\u201d\nApparently, they think they can fool us in the next phase of the program of moral subversion that this incredible Pope seriously expects us to believe is an imperative of \u201cmercy\u201d: the justification of contraception in \u201ccomplex cases\u201d to which \u201cdiscernment\u201d must be applied.\nConsider the recent declaration by one of Francis\u2019s new appointments to the Pontifical Academy for Life, whose entire membership he sacked and whose constitution he ordered rewritten to neutralize it.\nIn a lecture at the Gregorian, one Father Maurizio Chiodi, a \u201cmoral theologian\u201d of the post-Vatican II variety, proposed that \u201can artificial method for the regulation of births could be recognized as anact of responsibilitythat is carried out, not in order to radically reject the gift of a child, but because in those situationsresponsibility calls the couple and the family to other forms of welcome and hospitality.\u201d\nThat is, Francis\u2019s man at the reconstituted Pontifical Academy declares openly that there is a duty to contracept!\nChiodi\u2019s sole \u201cauthority\u201d for this lie from the pit of hell is nothing more than Chapter 8 of AL, the only document of its kind in the entire history of the Church.\nAL will doubtless be providing cover for a whole new line of Authentic Magisterium\u00ae products, all of which will be utter fakes, including some form of \u201cpastoral integration\u201d of homosexual unions.\nEvidently, they do think we are fools or willing to play the fool in exchange for the benefits of respectable conformity in the midst of an unparalleled debacle for the Church.\n(Consider the example of Catholic Answers, which \u201cdefends the Faith\u201d while refusing to recognize that it is under ferocious attack from the very vertices of the Church.\nSilence at best is the price it must pay for remaining in good standing with the pro-homosexual bishop Francis has installed in San Diego.)\nBut we are not fools.\nAnd God will not be mocked.\nFrancis and all his designs will ultimately come to nothing.\nMeanwhile, ours is but to keep the Faith and protest before God and man the blows now raining down against the Church, even when they come from a wayward Roman Pontiff at her summit.\nIndeed, especially then.\n", ["Repetition", "Doubt",

the individual is released from local custody for any reason.\nMost of the aliens targeted by ERO deportation officers during this operation had prior criminal histories that included convictions for the following crimes: sexual assault, kidnapping, assault, assault with a weapon, drug possession, theft, obstruction of justice and driving under the influence (DUI); two were known fugitive immigration violators, and six were arrested for illegally re-entering the United States after having been deported, which is a felony.\nThe following are criminal summaries of the offenders arrested

have a place to live after many were driven from their homes due to the US, Russia and other countries putting their noses where they didn't belong and funding, training and arming Islamic jihadis there.\nThen, there are those who clearly come to the country to Islamasize the country because they have an Islamic dominionist attitude borne of the teachings of the Koran and Muhammad .\nRT reports:\nRefugees in Europe are just \u201cMuslim invaders\u201d and economic migrants seeking better lives, Hungarian PM Viktor Orban has said, adding that the large number of Muslims in the EU had led to the appearance of \u2018parallel societies.\u2019 Asked in an interview with the German Bild newspaper why Budapest does not want to accept any refugees, Orban replied: \u201cWe don\u2019t consider these people to be Muslim refugees.\u201d Instead, the tough-talking politician said they were regarded as \u201cMuslim invaders.\u201d Asylum seekers must cross four countries to reach

migrants heading for \u2018wealthy\u2019 Europe.\n\u201cSo, they are not running for their lives [in these countries].\nThey are merely economic migrants seeking a better life,\u201d Orban concluded.\nHe stressed though, that he can only speak for the Hungarians and they \u201cdon\u2019t want\u201d immigration.\nIn his view, the government simply can\u2019t go against the will of the people.\nAnd Orban has stayed the course, too while governments like that of Germany have ignored their people to allow for a clear invasion of Germany that has led to untold numbers of sexual assaults by Muslim migrants, attacks on Christians and there's no telling the amount of damage to the unethical welfare system in the country.\nRT continues:\nGoing further, the prime minister noted that no refugee wants to go to Portugal, for example, adding that the majority of asylum seekers simply wanted to live in prosperous Germany.\n\u201cThe reason why people are in your country is not because they are refugees, but because they want a German life,\u201d he said, describing the issue \u201cpolitically\u201d as a European problem but, \u201csociologically,\u201d as a German problem.\nOrban specifically targeted Germany and Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s \u2018open-door\u2019 policy towards asylum seekers.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never understood how chaos, anarchy and illegal border crossings are viewed as something good in a country like Germany, which we view as the best example of discipline and the rule of law,\u201d he said.\nThe recent wave of refugees reaching Europe is merely an invasion, according to Orban.\n\u201cIf someone wants to come to your house, he knocks on your door and asks: \u2018Can we come in, can we stay?\u2019 They [asylum seekers] didn\u2019t do that, they crossed the border illegally,\u201d he stated.\nOrban then did what most political representatives will simply not do, he told the truth about multiculturalism.\nHe called it an \"illusion\" and said that Christian and Muslim societies \u201cwill never unite.\u201d\nOf course, they won't.\nThey have absolutely nothing in common.\nThey cannot agree on God's law, which most Western societies were base on, including the united States.\nThey cannot agree on the Scriptures.\nThey cannot agree on the person and work of Jesus the Christ.\nThey can't even agree on the means of proselytizing and of what real spiritual weapons are.\nPM Orban has remained consistent.\nHe has publicly told the Muslim invaders to leave Hungary and never come back.\nHe has rebuffed Brussels, which is largely Islamic, and told them that Hungary would defend its borders, and it has.\nOrban's border wall reduced illegal immigration by 99%!\nHe has genuinely reached out his hand to help Christian migrants instead of Muslim migrants and he seems to be one that holds to the Christian faith, as emulated by the Protestant Reformers, saying, \"That which serves the glory of God is the best for the people.\"\nFurthermore, Orban has also called out the man behind the curtain in a lot of the promoting of this Muslim invasion of the West, George Soros.\nAnti-jihadist activist Pamela Geller praised Orban for his honesty and wrote, \"At last, a politician who speaks the truth about the Muslim invasion of Europe.\nAnd while Orban is right that these are 'economic migrants,' they are also 'Muslim invaders.'\"\n\"They don\u2019t want a 'German life' in Germany in the sense that they are willing to accept German values,\" she added.\n\"Many, all too many, of them want to overwhelm

Scandal\nThis report was originally published by Tyler Durden at Zero Hedge\nThe Department of Justice unsealed an 11-count indictment on Friday to a former DoD intelligence analyst-turned uranium transportation executive who stands accused of a bribery and money laundering scheme involving a Russian nuclear official connected to the Uranium One deal.\nThe indictment corroborates a November report by The Hill that an FBI mole deeply embedded in the Russian uranium industry had gathered extensive evidence of the scheme.\nMark Lambert, 54, of Mount Airy, Maryland, was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering.\nThe charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of Russia\u2019s State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX.\nAccording to the indictment, beginning at least as early as 2009 and continuing until October 2014, Lambert conspired with others at \u201cTransportation Corporation A\u201d to make corrupt and fraudulent bribery and kickback payments to offshore bank accounts associated with shell companies, at the direction of, and for the benefit of, a Russian official, Vadim Mikerin, in order to secure improper business advantages and obtain and retain business with TENEX.\n\u2013DOJ\nWhile the indictment lists Lambert\u2019s company as \u201cTransportation Corporation A,\u201d a simple search reveals that Lambert is the co-President of DAHER-TLI, \u201cthe leading front end freight forwarding company dedicated to Nuclear Cargo,\u201d according to its website.\nIn 2012, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission sent a letter to Lambert with findings that TLI had exported plutonium \u201cin excess of the maximum quantity and type applied for and licensed,\u201d and \u201cexported Australian obligated material, which was not authorized under license conditions.\u201d\nPrior to his 26 year tenure in the transportation industry \u2013 20 of which have been with TLI, Mr. Lambert was an Arabic Linguist for the Navy for five years, and a Senior Intel Analyst for the Department of Defense (DoD) for three years.\nLambert also speaks fluent Arabic and Farsi (Persian), along with French and Italian.\nThe indictment against Lambert corroborates prior reporting by The Hill that an FBI mole buried deep within the Russian nuclear industry had gathered extensive evidence of a scheme involving bribes and kickbacks between Russian nuclear officials and TLI \u2013 which would have transported the U.S. uranium sold to Russia in the \u201920 percent\u2019 Uranium One deal.\n\u201cThe Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns.\nAnd none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,\u201d a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.\u201d\nBased on what the FBI knew \u2013 including evidence which purportedly includes a video of Russians preparing briefcases of bribe money \u2013 the Uranium One deal never should have gone through.\nMoreover, both Robert Mueller and current deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein were directly involved \u2013 and current Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other Justice Department officials appear to be covering for them.\nIn short, the FBI had ample evidence of the Russian bribery plot before the Obama administration approved the Uranium One deal thanks to their embedded mole in the Russian nuclear industry.\nThe informant \u2013 outed as energy consultant William Campbell \u2013 was \u201cthreatened\u201d by Obama admin AG Loretta Lynch to keep quiet with an iron-clad gag order, according to his attorney \u2013 former Reagan Justice Dept.\nofficial and former Chief Counsel to the Senate Intelligence Committee Victoria Toensing.\nAfter Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-VA) demanded Campbell be allowed to testify in front of Congress, the gag order was lifted.\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions originally tried to claim that there was no connection between Uranium One and the nuclear transport bribery case, however several congressional republicans pushed back:\n\u201cAttorney General Sessions seemed to say that the bribery, racketeering and money laundering offenses involving Tenex\u2019s Vadim Mikerin occurred after the approval of the Uranium One deal by the Obama administration.\nBut we know that the FBI\u2019s confidential informant was actively compiling incriminating evidence as far back as 2009,\u201d Rep. Ron DeSantis, (R-Fla.) told The Hill.\n\u201cIt is hard to fathom how such a transaction could have been approved without the existence of the underlying corruption being disclosed.\nI hope AG Sessions gets briefed about the CI and gives the Uranium One case the scrutiny it deserves,\u201d added DeSantis, whose House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittees is one of the investigating panels.\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) sent a similar rebuke last week to Rosenstein, saying the deputy attorney general\u2019s first response to the committee \u201clargely missed the point\u201d of the congressional investigations.\n\u201cThe essential question is whether the Obama Justice Department provided notice of the criminal activity of certain officials before the CFIUS approval of the Uranium One deal and other government decisions that enabled the Russians to trade nuclear materials in the U.S,\u201d Grassley scolded.\u201d\nMeanwhile, journalists John Solomon and journalist Sara Carter claim to have copies of the FBI informant\u2019s evidence, while Carter issued an explosive report in late November laying out the players, the timeline, and the evidence at hand.\n\u201cBy the time the sale of Uranium One was approved by the Obama Administration, the FBI\u2019s investigators had already gathered substantial evidence and the bureau was also aware of Russia\u2019s intentions to enter the U.S. energy market and its desire to purchase a stake in American uranium,\u201d Carter writes.\nHighlights:\nFBI mole William Campbell was a highly valued FBI asset \u2013 paid $51,000 by FBI officials at a celebration dinner in Chrystal City, VA, where Campbell\u2019s attorney says they thanked him for his service.\nCampbell was required by the Russians, under threat, to launder large sums of money \u2013 which allowed the FBI to uncover a massive Russian \u201cnuclear money laundering apparatus\u201d\nCampbell collected over 5,000 documents and briefs over a six year period\nCampbell uncovered a Russian plot to penetrate the Obama administration and gain approval for the Uranium One sale, including a 2010 email which describes \u201cRussia\u2019s intent on expanding its Uranium expansion in the United States.\u201d\n\u201cThis is not just about bribery and kickbacks but about a U.S. company that was transporting yellow-cake for the Russians with our approval,\u201d an unnamed U.S. Intelligence official told Carter, adding \u201cThis should raise serious questions.\nAt the time everyone was concerned about Russia\u2019s ties to Iran, we still are.\nAnd of course, Russia\u2019s intentions and reach into the U.S. energy market.\u201d\nGiven Friday\u2019s unsealed indictment, however it looks like the DOJ may have changed their tune on Campbell.\nIf so, perhaps that \u201cbriefcase full of bribe money\u201d video will finally see the light of day.\n", ["Loaded_Language",

is a religion of peace than that you believe in, say, the Nicene Creed.\nAnd the Pope is almost certain to ignore this heartfelt appeal, as he has ignored others who have respectfully questioned his departures from Catholic teaching.\nI have yet to meet a Catholic prelate who believes that the requirement to treat all charitably applies to those who hold opinions that have been deemed unacceptable.\n\u201cLeave them; they are blind guides.\nAnd if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.\u201d (Matthew 15:14)\n\u201cIslamic Converts Ask Pope in Open Letter To Change His Teaching on Islam,\u201d by Steve Skojec, OnePeterFive.com, January 11, 2018:\nA new, open letter to the pope is making the rounds on the Internet, and it has gathered over 2,600 signatures so far.\n\u201cMost Holy Father,\u201d it begins, \u201c\u202cMany of us \u202chave tried to contact you, \u202con many occasions \u202cand for several years, \u202cand we have never received the slightest acknowledgement of our letters or requests for meetings.\u201d\nThe letter is not from the dubia cardinals, or from the more than 800,000 signers of the 2015 Filial Appeal, or from the signatories of the Filial Correction, but from a group of Islamic converts to Catholicism, who want Francis to answer a simple question: why did they literally risk their lives to become Catholic if Islam is \u201ca good religion in itself\u201d as the pope \u201cseems to teach\u201d?\nIt\u2019s a question he refuses to answer, despite endless platitudes of how important it is to be close to the marginalized and to accompany those on the peripheries of the Church.\nThe signers, however, are not dissuaded in their pursuit of a paternal answer:\nYou do not like to beat around the bush, and neither do we, so allow us to say frankly that we do not understand your teaching about Islam, as we read in paragraphs 252 and 253 of Evangelii Gaudium, because it does not account for the fact that Islam came AFTER Christ, and so is, and can only be, an Antichrist (see 1 Jn 2.22), and one of the most dangerous because it presents itself as the fulfillment of Revelation (of which Jesus would have been only a prophet).\nIf Islam is a good religion in itself, as you seem to teach, why did we become Catholic?\nDo not your words question the soundness of the choice we made at the risk of our lives?\nIslam prescribes death for apostates (Quran 4.89, 8.7-11), do you know?\nHow is it possible to compare Islamic violence with so-called Christian violence?\n\u201cWhat is the relationship between Christ and Satan?\nWhat union is there between light and darkness?\nWhat association between the faithful and the unfaithful?\u201d (2 Cor 6: 14-17)In accordance with His teaching (Lk 14:26), we preferred Him, the Christ, to our own life.\nAre we not in a good position to talk to you about Islam?\nThe letter makes short work of the notion that Islam and Christianity can ever be compatible, or that Islam can serve as a path to salvation:\nIn fact, as long as Islam wants us to be its enemy, we are, and all our protestations of friendship cannot change anything.\nAs a proper Antichrist, Islam exists only as an enemy of all: \u201cBetween us and you there is enmity and hatred forever, until you believe in Allah alone!\u201d (Qur\u2019an 60.4) For the Qur\u2019an, Christians \u201care only impurity\u201d (Quran 9.28),\u201d \u201cthe worst of Creation\u201d (Qur\u2019an 98.6), all condemned to Hell (Qur\u2019an 4.48), so Allah must exterminate them (Quran 9.30).\nWe must not be deceived by the Quranic verses deemed tolerant, because they have all been repealed by the verse of the Sword (Quran 9.5).\nWhere the Gospel proclaims the good news of Jesus\u2019 death and resurrection for the salvation of all, and the fulfillment of the Covenant initiated with the Hebrews, Allah has nothing to offer but war and murder of the \u201cinfidels\u201d in exchange for his paradise: \u201cThey fight on the way of Allah, they kill and are killed.\u201d (Quran 9:11) We do not confuse Islam with Muslims, but if for you \u201cdialogue\u201d means the voice of peace, for Islam it\u2019s only another way to make war.\nAlso, as it was in the face of Nazism and communism, naivet\u00e9 in the face of Islam is suicidal and very dangerous.\nHow can you speak of peace and endorse Islam, as you seem to do: \u201cTo wring from our hearts the disease that plagues our lives (\u2026) Let those who are Christians do it with the Bible and those who are Muslims do it with the Quran.\n\u201c(Rome, January 20, 2014)?\nThat the Pope seems to propose the Quran as a way of salvation, is that not cause for worry?\nShould we return to Islam?\nThe authors say that Islam can be no ally in the battle \u201cagainst the powers that want to dominate and enslave the world\u201d because \u201cthey share the same totalitarian logic based on the rejection of the kingship of Christ (Lk 4.7).\u201d They contest the idea that speaking in an \u201cIslamophilic tone\u201d will help those Christians who are suffering persecution in Muslim countries, professing that \u201capart from the fact that Jesus has never indicated any other way than that of the Cross, so that we must find our joy therein and not flee with all the damned, we do not doubt that only the proclamation of the Truth brings with it not only salvation, but freedom as well (John 8.32).\u201d\nThe letter also contrasts the stance of Islamic countries like Turkey and Saudi Arabia who \u201cdo not welcome any refugee\u201d while Pope Francis preaches\nthe welcoming of migrants regardless of the fact that they are Muslims, something forbidden by Apostolic command: \u201cIf anyone comes to you but refuses this Gospel, do not receive him among you nor greet him.\nWhoever greets him participates in his evil works.\u201d (2 John 1.10-11); \u201cIf anyone preaches to you a different Gospel, let him be accursed!\u201d (Galatians 1.8-9)\nThe signatories go on to give voice to the utter scandal of the pope\u2019s failure to carry out his evangelical mission as the Vicar of Christ to call home the members of the Islamic faith:\nThe pro-Islam speech of Your Holiness leads us to deplore the fact that Muslims are not invited to leave Islam, and that many ex-Muslims, such as Magdi Allam, are even leaving the Church, disgusted by her cowardice, wounded by equivocal gestures, confused by the lack of evangelization, scandalized by the praise given to Islam \u2026 Thus ignorant souls are misled\u2026\nTaking the matter further, they warn, too, of the physical danger the pope\u2019s disposition toward Islam invites, saying that it has resulted in Christians\nnot preparing for a confrontation with Islam, to which St. John Paul II has called them (Ecclesia in Europa, No.\n57).\nWe are under the impression that you do not take your brother Bishop Nona Amel, Chaldean-Catholic Archbishop of Mosul in exile, seriously, when he tells us: \u201cOur present sufferings are the prelude to those that you, Europeans and Western Christians, will suffer in the near future.\nI have lost my diocese.\nThe headquarters of my archdiocese and my apostolate have been occupied by radical Islamists who want us to convert or die.\n(\u2026) You are welcoming into your country an ever increasing number of Muslims.\nYou are in danger as well.\nYou must make strong and courageous decisions (\u2026).\nYou think that all men are equal, but Islam does not say that all men are equal.\n(\u2026) If you do not understand this very quickly, you will become the victims of the enemy that you have invited into your home.\u201d (August 9, 2014) \u201c.\nThis is a matter of life and death, and any complacency towards Islam is treasonous.\nWe do not wish the West to continue with Islamization, nor that your actions contribute to it.\nWhere then would we go to seek refuge?\nThe signatories plea is that the pope will \u201cquickly convene a synod on the dangers of Islam.\u201d\n", ["Appeal_to_fear-prejudice", "Doubt", "Black-and-White_Fallacy", "Exaggeration,Minimisation",

Pope Francis Accused of Inaction in Notorious Sex Abuse Cases\nThe incident was brief: on the Thursday of the pope\u2019s week-long South American trip, in response to an impromptu question tossed out by a Chilean reporter, the pope responded in what one reporter described as a \u201csnippy tone\u201d: \u201cThe day I see proof against Bishop Barros, then I will talk.\nThere is not a single piece of evidence against him.\nIt is all calumny.\nIs that clear?\u201d\nThis month has been quite a spectacle, even for this pontificate; an apparently unending stream of outrages and embarrassments, with the pope and his Vatican media support jumping from one scandal to the next.\nBut among secular reporters the sex abuse issue trumps all others and the fallout continues to blaze down on the Bergoglian pontificate in response to his amazing accusation earlier this month that victims of sexual abuse by clergy were engaging in \u201ccalumny,\u201d in their accusations against a Chilean bishop, Juan de la Cruz Barros Madrid.\nIt seems the shine is coming off the papal penny among leftist secular journalists, his natural constituency.\nWriting for the Boston Globe, the paper that first broke the clerical sex abuse scandals all the way back in 2001, Kevin Cullen wrote, \u201cLet the record show that the promise of Pope Francis died in Santiago, Chile, on Jan. 18, in the year of our Lord 2018\u2026 he has revealed himself like no one else could.\u201d\nBut it gets worse than this.\nWhen a \u201cleftist\u201d pope pressing a secularist agenda on the Church starts to lose the support of Michael Sean Winters and the National Catholic Reporter, he must know he\u2019s in trouble.\nThough he\u2019s \u201csticking with Francis\u201d for now, Winters wrote, \u201cI wish I knew what it was about Pope Francis that makes him fail to grasp the situation with Bishop Barros, the pain caused to the victims and the damage done to the church.\nI am gobsmacked that the pope twice declined to accept the bishop\u2019s resignation.\u201d\nOn January 23rd, an unsigned NCR editorial opined, \u201cWithin the space of four days, Pope Francis twice slandered abuse survivors.\u201d\n\u201cThese remarks are at the least shameful.\nAt the most, they suggest that Francis now could be complicit in the cover-up.\nThe script is all too familiar: Discredit the survivors\u2019 testimony, support the prelate in question, and bank on public attention moving on to something else.\n\u201cThe insistence with which Francis defends Barros is mystifying.\nThree separate journalists on the papal flight gave the pope opportunity to say why exactly he believed the bishop instead of the survivors accusing him.\nThe second journalist to ask Francis about Barros on the flight was a Chilean woman.\nAs she spoke to the pope, her voice cracked with nervousness at questioning the church\u2019s top leader.\nShe asked: \u2018Why are not the victims\u2019 testimonies proof for you?\nWhy do you not believe them?\u2019 The pope gave no satisfying answer, only repeating a claim of \u2018no evidence\u2019 against the bishop.\u201d\nIndeed, it was understood, as the Washington Post said, that Francis\u2019 trip to Latin America \u2013 dogged by protests over Barros both in person at the pope\u2019s appearances and in the press \u2013 was in part intended as \u201can apology tour\u201d to abuse survivors.\nWhich is why his accusation of calumny against those same victims the next day came as such a shock to observers unused to Bergoglio\u2019s ability to turn on a dime.\nAll was going as planned.\nOn Wednesday, January 17, the pope met as scheduled with selected survivors of sexual abuse by priests.\nHe made all the right noises, talking about his \u201cpain and shame,\u201d and reportedly even crying, at what happened.\n\u201cI know the pain of these cases of child abuse and I am following how much is needed to overcome this serious and painful evil,\u201d he said.\n24 hours later he was calling them liars.\nJames Hamilton, 49 and now a doctor, was one of the Barros accusers.\nHe told the BBC at a press conference, \u201cWhat the Pope has done today is offensive and painful, and not only against us, but against everyone seeking to end the abuses.\u201d The lead voice of the victims in Chile, Juan Carlos Cruz, tweeting to one of Francis\u2019s leading apologists, Austen Ivereigh, said, \u201cDoes he need a photo, a selfie, as proof?\nSorry Austen, we didn\u2019t think of it as we were being abused and Juan Barros watching.\u201d\nAlthough the issue came to the attention of a much broader audience during the most recent papal trip, the outcry has been ongoing since his appointment to the southern Chilean diocese of Osorno in 2015.\nBarros was a student prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of the charismatic homosexual/pederast predator Fernando Karadima, and went on to be ordained in 1984, made bishop in 1995 and appointed as bishop of the armed forces.\nBarros claimed in court that the first he knew of Karadima\u2019s offenses was on a Chilean television programme in 2010.\nThis is refuted by Karadima\u2019s victims \u2013 deemed credible both by the secular courts and the Vatican tribunal \u2013 who testified that he personally witnessed the abuse at Sacred Heart of Jesus church in Santiago.\nLast Thursday, however, was not the first time Francis, confronted unexpectedly in public over the Barros question, has responded testily and with insults.\nIn 2015 the Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano published a video of him scolding two women who spoke with him in St. Peter\u2019s Piazza, asking that he reconsider the appointment, citing the \u201csuffering\u201d of the Church in Chile over the issue.\nThe pope told the women, \u201cThe Church has lost its freedom, letting its head fill with politicians and accusing a bishop without having any proof, after twenty years of service, so think with your head.\u201d He warned them not to allow themselves to be led by \u201cleftists who have set up this thing.\u201d\n\u201cThe only charge against this bishop has been discredited by the Court of Justice, so please do not lose your serenity, you suffer, but because you are foolish...I am the first to judge and punish those accused of similar crimes, but in this case there is not even a proof.\u201d\nThe insults were not forgotten.\nAmong the signs held by protesters in Chile last week were those reading, \u201cNi zurdos, ni tontos,\u201d (Neither lefties nor stupid).\nThe jab certainly wasn\u2019t lost on Francis, since the signs were being held by protesters the full length of his auto route to Santiago from the airport.\nOne of the protesters told the BBC, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even know us, so how can he accuse us of being such things?\nHe thinks we are politically motivated even though we come from different parishes in Osorno and are doing this because we are against priests being allowed to abuse children.\u201d\nApparently His Holiness was informed that the \u201ccalumny\u201d comment had caused some blow-back because a couple of days later we got something touted \u2013 though somewhat skeptically \u2013 as a \u201ccontrite\u201d papal apology.\nThis also followed an astonishing public rebuke of the pope by Sean Cardinal O\u2019Malley \u2013 a member of the C9 council of cardinals and the former head of the pope\u2019s sex abuse commission \u2013 who said, \u201cIt is understandable that Pope Francis\u2019 statements yesterday in Santiago, Chile were a source of great pain for survivors of sexual abuse by clergy or any other perpetrator.\u201d\n\u201cPope Francis fully recognizes the egregious failures of the Church and its clergy who abused children and the devastating impact those crimes have had on survivors and their loved ones,\u201d O\u2019Malley said.\nOf course, Francis being Francis the apology was banked around with assertions of how right he was.\n\u201cI have to ask forgiveness because the word \u2018proof\u2019 wounded,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt wounded many people who were abused\u2026I ask them for forgiveness because I wounded them without realizing it, but it was an unintended wound.\nAnd this horrified me a lot, because I had received them.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I know how much they suffer, to feel that the Pope says in their face \u2018bring me a letter, a proof.\u2019 It\u2019s a slap.\nAnd I agree that my expression was not apt, because I didn\u2019t think.\u201d\nHe doubled down, saying, \u201cI have not heard any victim of Barros.\nThey did not come, they did not show themselves, they did not give evidence in court.\nIt\u2019s all in the air.\nIt is true that Barros was in Karadima\u2019s group of young people.\nBut let us be clear: if you accuse someone without evidence with pertinacity, that is calumny.\u201d\n\u201cThis is what I can say with sincerity.\nBarros will remain there if I don\u2019t find a way to condemn him.\nI cannot condemn him if I don\u2019t have \u2013 I don\u2019t say proof \u2013 but evidence.\nAnd there are many ways to get evidence.\nIs that clear?\u201d\nThis \u201ccontrite\u201d papal apology didn\u2019t fly well even with the regular news reporters.\nPhilip Pullela, a reporter on the plane for Reuters, described it as \u201can extremely rare act of self-criticism,\u201d for the \u201cunusually contrite\u201d Bergoglio, and noted that, \u201cWhile the pope has vowed \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 for sexual abuse, his efforts have sputtered.\u201d\nIndeed, Francis claim that he met with and heard the \u201cpain\u201d of the victims is untrue in the specific case in hand.\nCBS News reports that though the Osorno group had tried to obtain a meeting during the trip they were refused.\nGreg Burke, the pope\u2019s press officer, confirmed that \u201cno papal meetings were planned with the Osorno group, which had formally requested to meet with the pope in July but were told by Vatican organizers that his schedule was already final, some six months before the trip.\u201d\nWho is Barros?\nSome may remember a video that made the internet rounds of an uproar in a Chilean cathedral at the installation ceremony of a bishop.\nAt the time it didn\u2019t draw much attention from the English language press \u2013 mostly at that time distracted by the ongoing battle of the notorious Kasper Proposal and the oncoming Synods.\nBut despite the pope\u2019s claim, the charges against Barros are serious and have been deemed credible by a judge.\nHe is accused of having covered up sexual abuse, including destroying evidence, committed by Karadima in the \u201880s and \u201890s.\nIn fact \u2013 and this point has tended to get glossed over in the press \u2013 Barros is accused by the victims of having been in the room, watching at the time, and of engaging in sexual activity with Karadima.\nThis is not, therefore, merely a matter of a bishop or colleague discovering the abuse after the fact, but of being a voyeuristic participant.\nJuan Carlos Cruz, told the press in 2015 that he and another boy \u2013 both in their teens at the time \u2013 \u201cwould lie down on the priest\u2019s [Karadima\u2019s] bed, one resting his head at the man\u2019s shoulder, another sitting near his feet.\nThe priest would kiss the boys and grope them, he said, all while the Rev.\nJuan Barros watched.\u201d Cruz, now a 51-year-old \u201cgay\u201d journalist, told The Associated Press, \u201cBarros was there, and he saw it all.\u201d\nA Vatican investigation found Karadima guilty in 2011 and sentenced him to a life of seclusion in a monastery for \u201cpenitence and prayer.\u201d Note that date; 2011 was when the processes for investigating and trying priest-abusers, put in place by the former Cardinal Ratzinger, were still in effect, and while he was still sitting on the Petrine throne.\nThings are a bit different now.\nNeither was the complaint against Barros without the support of responsible people.\nThe media reported that over 1,300 Catholic faithful in Osorno, including 30 priests of the diocese and 51 members of Parliament, wrote to the pope asking him to rescind the appointment \u2013 none of which received any response.\nFr.\nPeter Kleigel, a priest of Osorno, told Associated Press, \u201cWe\u2019re convinced that this appointment is not correct because, following canon law, a bishop must be well-regarded.\nWe need a bishop who\u2019s credible.\u201d\nThe problem with getting the news out about Karadima, as in most of these cases, was the bishop, in this case Cardinal Francisco Javier Err\u00e1zuriz of Santiago, who after the Conclave of 2013 was appointed a member of Pope Francis\u2019s C9 inner council.\nIt was certainly never a secret that Err\u00e1zuriz was a close, like-minded friend and collaborator of then-Cardinal Bergoglio, the kingpin of South American Catholicism.\nAllegations against Karadima \u2013 that went back to 1962 \u2013 had certainly been reported to Church authorities well before a Chilean news agency revealed the case in 2010, but were ignored by Err\u00e1zuriz.\nEven the National Catholic Reporter in 2014 pointed to the cover up and the relationship between the new pope and the accused cardinals,\n\u201cHamilton had applied for a marriage annulment, after telling his wife of a long psychosexual entanglement with Karadima that began when he was 17 in El Bosque.\nHis wife confided in a priest, who told Err\u00e1zuriz in 2006.\nWhen a canon lawyer and several priests close to the cardinal suggested that Hamilton not mention Karadima, he pressed on with his request in order to force the issue of punishment for the priest while having his marriage annulled.\nAgain, Err\u00e1zuriz refused to take action against Karadima.\u201d\nThe pope\u2019s claim that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d flies in the face of the ruling of the civil judge in the Karadima case \u2013 a fact that ought to be of paramount consideration under the Vatican\u2019s own rules for determining credibility in such cases.\nWhile Judge Jessica Gonzalez was forced to drop criminal charges because the statute of limitations had expired, she affirmed that testimony by Cruz and other victims was credible.\nAfter a full year of investigation, Gonzalez called their claims \u201ctruthful and reliable\u201d.\nVictims said that a letter written to Church authorities complaining of Karadima\u2019s abuse in 1982 was intercepted and destroyed by Barros, who was serving at the time as secretary to Cardinal Francisco Fresno, Err\u00e1zuriz\u2019s successor and collaborator.\nAs for Barros\u2019s general credibility as a Catholic bishop, the witness of the victims is damning.\nIn a letter to Bishop Ivo Scapolo, papal nuncio to Chile, that Cruz gave to the Associated Press, he said he witnessed Karadima and Barros in an intimate relationship.\n\u201cI saw Karadima and Juan Barros kissing and touching each other.\nThe groping generally came from Karadima touching Barros\u2019 genitals\u201d.\nBarros has never denied having had a close friendship with Karadima.\nHamilton confirmed this saying, \u201cI saw how Barros watched it all.\u201d\nAnd the matter didn\u2019t end in 2010.\nEmails published in Chile in 2015 showed that Cardinal Err\u00e1zuriz also blocked the appointment of Juan Carlos Cruz from the new child protection commission \u2013 a group plagued by such scandals and eventually ignored to death by Francis.\nWhich brings us to Francis Bergoglio\u2019s own record in this area.\nThe pope claimed \u201cI am the first to judge and punish those accused of similar crimes,\u201d but this claim is not supported by the reality.\nIndeed, it has been pointed out that Francis has gone to considerable lengths to dismantle the efforts of his predecessor at \u201csafeguarding\u201d young people, punishing abusers and removing bishops who cover it up.\nIn the case of Barros, the Associated Press obtained a confidential letter from Pope Francis dated 2015 that \u201creveals the [Chilean] bishops\u2019 concern about Francis naming a Karadima prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Bishop Juan Barros.\u201d Just days before the pope\u2019s \u201ccalumny\u201d comment, January 11, AP reported that Francis had full knowledge of the controversy he risked in appointing Barros to Osorno.\n\u201c[H]is ambassador in Chile had tried to find a way to contain the damage well before the case made headlines.\u201d\nThe letter, addressed to the executive committee of the Chilean bishops\u2019 conference, said, \u201cThank you for having openly demonstrated the concern that you have about the appointment of Monsignor Juan Barros.\nI understand what you\u2019re telling me and I\u2019m aware that the situation of the church in Chile is difficult due to the trials you\u2019ve had to undergo.\u201d The letter said that in 2014 the nuncio, Archbishop Scapolo, had asked Barros to resign as bishop of the armed forces and had \u201cencouraged him to take a sabbatical year before assuming any other pastoral responsibility as a bishop.\u201d\nThere can also be little doubt the new pope was fully aware of the record of his close friend Cardinal Err\u00e1zuriz in ignoring complaints of Karadima\u2019s victims when he appointed him to the C9 council.\nAnd even if he didn\u2019t then, he certainly knows now, and yet Errazuriz continues in that advisory role.\nFrancis further appointed Cardinal Err\u00e1zuriz to serve as his Special Envoy to World Apostolic Congress Of Mercy III meeting in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia in June 2014.\nSince 2001, Cardinal Ratzinger and later as Pope Benedict installed effective procedural reforms on clerical sexual abuse; Francis in his short five years has all but completely dismantled or reversed those changes.\nAmong the earliest indications Catholics had that the new pope had no intention of getting to the bottom of the priest-abuser problem was his appointment of the notorious homosexual, Monsignor Battista Ricca, as head of the Vatican Bank and the man in charge of his own residence, the Casa Santa Martha.\nIt is often forgotten that Bergoglio\u2019s notorious comment \u201cwho am I to judge\u201d was in response to a question on a plane-presser about Ricca, and was followed with a similar claim from Francis about there having been no proof of his misbehaviour.\nAs the pseudonymous Marcantonio Colonna wrote in the book, \u201cThe Dictator Pope,\u201d \u201cIn fact his patronage of Monsignor Ricca fits the pattern which was well established when he was Archbishop of Buenos Aires, whereby he surrounds himself with morally weak people so as to have them under his thumb.\u201d\nBut even before this was the sinister appearance of Godfried Cardinal Danneels on the loggia on the night of Francis\u2019s election to the papacy.\nDanneels\u2019s prominence in the Bergoglian pontificate continues to be the most prominent indicator of the pope\u2019s deprioritising of clerical sexual abuse.\nThe former head of the Brussels archdiocese was a leading figure in the so-called St. Gallen Group, which he himself described as a \u201cmafia,\u201d who had worked against the election of Joseph Ratzinger in 2005 and to elect Bergoglio in 2013.\nAt the end of a long career as Europe\u2019s leading \u201cliberal\u201d Catholic prelate, Danneels came under a cloud of scandal when he was accused of having covered for a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 bishop who admitted to having sexually abused his own minor nephew.\nIn 2010 the publication of an audio recording determined undeniably that Danneels had told the victim to keep quiet and not cause trouble for the soon-to-retire Bishop Roger Vangheluwe of Bruges.\nThe cardinal even went so far as to suggest that the victim should \u201cask forgiveness\u201d for his own role in the scandal.\nBefore the recordings were released, Danneels had also denied all knowledge of sexual abuse by clergy or cover-ups.\nIn the book, Colonna asks the question, \u201cWhat happened to \u2018Zero Tolerance\u2019 for clerical sexual offenders?\u201d He wrote that data presented by the Vatican the UN Human Rights Commission in January 2014 showed that Benedict XVI \u201chad defrocked or suspended more than 800 priests for past sexual abuse between 2009 and 2012,\u201d including the notorious Fr.\nMaciel Degollado, founder of the Legionaries of Christ.\nCrucially, it was Ratzinger who moved the competence for sex abuse cases from the Congregation for Bishops to Doctrine of the Faith, with powers to suspend and punish offenders.\nHis reforms specifically included bishops who had refused to act against priest-abusers.\nA senior member of the Vatican\u2019s diplomatic corps, Archbishop Miguel Maury Buendia, confirmed this, saying, \u201cThis Pope has removed two or three bishops per month throughout the world...\nThere have been two or three instances in which they said no, and so the Pope simply removed them.\u201d\nThese reforms \u2013 and removals \u2013 have ceased entirely under Francis.\nDespite his claims that he punishes the guilty, it was in fact Francis who reversed the previous, Benedict-era sentence against the notorious Italian priest-pederast Mario Inzoli at the request of the now-equally notorious Cardinal Coccopalmerio.\nInzoli was found guilty in 2012 by an ecclesiastical court of abusing boys as young as twelve and suspended.\nInzoli had even abused boys in the confessional, convincing them that the abuse was approved by God.\nFollowing an appeal by Coccopalmerio, Francis reduced the priest\u2019s penalty to a \u201clifetime of prayer,\u201d with permission to say Mass privately, and a promise to stay away from children.\nThe uproar over this caused the Italian prosecutors to reopen the case against the priest, and eventually Inzoli went to prison and was laicized.\nAs for Ratzinger/Benedict\u2019s procedural reforms, rumours continue to circulate that the pope intends to reverse them as well, placing competence back into the hands of the same dicastery that held it when the scandals broke in 2001.\nThis has been denied by Greg Burke, but given Francis\u2019s usual methods, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess who in reality is actually dealing with these cases, if anyone.\nA tribunal of bishops, requested by his own sex abuse commission, was ignored and then Francis summarily removed two of the CDF staffers in charge of handling such cases, famously refusing to give any reasons to CDF prefect Cardinal M\u00fcller who was soon to be dismissed.\nIn fact, the chaos and lack of commitment on the issue has come under harsh criticism from at least one member of the pope\u2019s now-defunct sex abuse commission, a loudly trumpeted part of Bergoglio\u2019s early scheme of reform.\nMarie Collins, an Irish abuse survivor, was appointed in 2014 to the new Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors.\nShe resigned in 2017, citing \u201cVatican officials\u2019 reluctance to cooperate with its work to protect children.\u201d Collins released a damning statement, indicating that the commission had never seriously intended to change or reform anything.\nShe said none of the commission\u2019s recommendations had been implemented.\n\u201cThe reluctance of some in the Vatican Curia to implement recommendations or cooperate with the work of a commission when the purpose is to improve the safety of children and vulnerable adults around the world is unacceptable,\u201d Collins wrote.\nAs of December last year, the commission has been allowed to lapse, and no longer functions, though it has not been definitively dissolved.\nThe terms of office of its members expired December 17th.\nThis week Collins tweeted her question for Pope Francis on the Chilean situation: \u201cWhy does the Pope not believe these three men?\nThey have been consistent over years in what they say.\nWhen asked why he believes his fellow cleric and not the survivors he can give no good reason.\u201d\nWhy indeed.\n", ["Thought-terminating_Cliches", "Appeal_to_fear-prejudice", "Doubt", "Exaggeration,Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Whataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring", "Name_Calling,Labeling",

Gulf\nYesterday\u2019s State of the Union address issued by Donald Trump represented a refreshing break from the eight years of pusillanimous foreign policies pursued by past administration.\nNowhere was this more evident than in the manner in which Trump described Iran\u2019s repressive regime and attempts by the Iranian people to overthrow it through peaceful protest.\nWhen it comes to Iran\u2019s governing authorities, the Trump administration is under no illusions about the nefarious nature of this fascist theocracy.\n\u201cWe are restoring clarity about our adversaries,\u201d Trump stated in a not too subtle jibe at his predecessor who seemed to be in a perpetual state of confusion about who his friends and enemies were.\nTrump also referenced the recent widespread Iranian protests, crushed with extreme ruthlessness by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and its Basij auxiliary militia.\n\u201cWhen the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of a corrupt dictatorship,\u201d he stated, \u201cI did not stay silent.\nAmerica stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.\u201d\nBy contrast, Barack Obama and his obsequious acolytes were besotted by the prospect of forging d\u00e9tente with the despotic mullahs of the Islamic Republic.\nHis administration remained largely silent when Iranians took to the streets in 2009 to protest a rigged election.\nSome have speculated that his administration missed out on a prime opportunity for regime change.\nIt was only downhill from there.\nIn a misguided effort to secure Iran\u2019s willingness to sign the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Obama sold everything including the kitchen sink.\nHe tried selling the American people on the na\u00efve notion that there were moderate elements of import in the Iranian government, ignoring the obvious fact that all authority in Iran is vested with the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and his IRGC henchmen.\nThe tried and true concept of peace through strength gave way to fecklessness through appeasement.\nRansom payments to the tune of $1.7 billion were transferred to Iran.\nPromising criminal investigations targeting Iran\u2019s chief terror proxy, Hezbollah, were shut down.\nTargeted liquidation operations by our Israeli allies against Iranian Quds Force leaders were foiled after Obama tipped off Tehran on Israel\u2019s intentions.\nIranian material breaches of the JCPOA were all but ignored while Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program was allowed to proceed at full speed despite being in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolution 2231.\nObama\u2019s near messianic zealotry in his interactions with the mullahs severely compromised America\u2019s national security and weakened its image on the international stage.\nWorse, it emboldened the mullahs (appeasement tends to do that) who seemed to revel in Obama\u2019s groveling.\nIran\u2019s mischief-making extends far and wide but it is in the Arabian Gulf where friction between the IRGC and the United States Navy remains constant.\nIran regards the Arabian Gulf as its domain and but for the presence of the U.S. 5th Fleet, would have full reign over its waters, which include the strategic Strait of Hormuz.\nIn addition to securing the Gulf, the 5th Fleet serves as a constant reminder to the Iranians of their impotence.\nBut the deterrent effect of the Navy\u2019s 5th Fleet, and for that matter America\u2019s military might, is only as effective as the political leadership that commands it, and Barack Obama as Commander in Chief of the armed forces did little to instill fear or project deterrence.\nOn the contrary, the Iranians correctly viewed him as weak, indecisive and ineffectual.\nOn his watch, American warships patrolling the Gulf were harried by armed IRGC speed boats and larger navy frigates with near impunity.\nAt times Iranian naval vessels closed to within 600 to 150 yards of American warships.\nThe navy termed these near ritualistic, belligerent encounters, \u201cunsafe and unprofessional.\u201d\nIranian arrogance and impudence reached its zenith with the January 12th 2016 seizure of two American riverine command boats and their crews near Farsi Island.\nThe RCBs and crews manning them were returned some 16 hours later but not before the Iranians stole two satellite phone sim cards, likely containing classified information, as well as thousands of pages of information downloaded from laptops, GPS devices and maps used by the sailors.\nIronically, the seizure occurred on the very day that Obama was to give his State of the Union address but predictably, he didn\u2019t think that the seizure of Americans was important enough to note.\nBut according to the Navy, the past five months have witnessed markedly less belligerent conduct from the Iranians, leaving Navy officials baffled by the sudden positive change in attitude.\nIn fact, Iran\u2019s attitude adjustment in the Arabian Gulf is no mystery and stems from the Trump administration\u2019s implementation of a new robust foreign policy vis-\u00e0-vis the Islamic Republic.\nSoon after taking office, Trump noted that \u201cIran [was] playing with fire\u201d and added that he wouldn\u2019t be as \u201ckind\u201d to the mullahs as Obama was.\nThis wasn\u2019t empty rhetoric.\nIt was backed up by tangible action.\nAdditional sanctions were imposed against Iran for acting in defiance of UNSCR 2231.\nSanctions were also imposed against the IRGC for supporting terrorism.\nTrump\u2019s DOJ revived and breathed new life into Project Cassandra, a promising anti-Hezbollah/IRGC law enforcement initiative shelved by Obama.\nMost importantly, Trump failed to certify the JCPOA noting material Iranian breaches, and has threatened to abrogate the deal in its entirety unless modifications are implemented.\nThose modifications would include an end to absurd sunset clauses in the JCPOA and tough restrictions on ballistic missile testing.\nThe mullahs have become cognizant of the fact that there\u2019s a new sheriff in town, one that backs up tough talk with action and doesn\u2019t ask \u201chow high\u201d when they say \u201cjump.\u201d Clearly, the IRGC\u2019s new docile posture in the Arabian Gulf is a direct consequence of this realization.\n", ["Bandwagon,Reductio_ad_hitlerum",

gunman in October's Las Vegas massacre, was arrested Friday on a charge of conspiring to manufacture and sell another type of ammunition -- armor-piercing bullets -- in violation of federal law.\nA criminal complaint alleges two unfired .308-caliber (7.62mm) rounds found in gunman Stephen Paddock's hotel room had Haig's fingerprints on them as well as tool marks from his workshop.\nThe bullets in the cartridges were armor-piercing, with an incendiary capsule in the nose, the complaint says.\nThe FBI on October 19 searched Haig's Mesa home and seized ammunition the agency says is armor-piercing, the complaint said.\nHaig did not have a license to manufacture armor-piercing ammunition, documents said.\nPolice say Paddock, 64, opened fire on October 1 from his 32nd-floor room at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay hotel onto a crowd attending a music festival, killing 58 people and shooting and injuring 422 others.\nMore than 850 others suffered other injuries in the attack.\nInvestigators say Paddock died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.\nDouglas Haig's name was revealed in the release of search warrant records.\nHaig, 55, appeared in court Friday and was released on his own recognizance with specific conditions not spelled out in court proceedings.\nHe is due in court again February 15 for a preliminary hearing.\nThe maximum penalty for manufacturing illegal ammunition is five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\nHaig's attorney, Marc J. Victor, told CNN he had no comment.\nCNN affiliate KNXV caught up with Victor outside court, and the lawyer said he couldn't say anything because of the ongoing case.\n\"My first obligation and only obligation is to my client,\" he told KNXV.\nThe complaint\nHaig was publicly linked to the Las Vegas investigation Tuesday when a judge unsealed months-old police search warrant records that named him as a person of interest\nIn a Friday morning news conference before his arrest, Haig, responding to the documents' release, said he sold tracer ammunition to Paddock at his home in September after they met at a gun show.\nTracer ammunition has a pyrotechnic charge that, when fired, leaves an illuminated trace that can help a shooter have a more precise idea of where the bullet is going.\nHaig did not describe the ammunition as armor-piercing.\nVictor, at the same news conference at his Phoenix-area office, said the tracer ammunition that Haig sold Paddock \"was not modified in any way ... from manufacturer's specs.\"\nBut in Friday's criminal complaint, investigators say Haig and an associate also claimed they sold to Paddock other ammunition -- four or five 10-round packages of .308-caliber incendiary ammunition -- at a Las Vegas gun show in August.\nIt's not clear from the complaint whether the two armor-piercing rounds with the incendiary capsule are from the packages Haig allegedly told investigators he sold Paddock at the gun show.\nThe complaint also does not say whether Paddock fired any of the ammunition that he bought from Haig.\nPhotos: Mass shooting at Las Vegas

which are meant to ignite what they hit -- in Friday's news conference.\nVictor, his attorney, declined to comment about CNN's questions about the incendiary rounds.\nThe complaint does not name

that Haig knew of Paddock's intentions to kill in Las Vegas.\nHaig says he saw nothing suspicious\nHaig, an aerospace engineer and part-time ammunition reseller, said at Friday's news conference that he never saw anything suspicious in his brief interactions with Paddock.\nPaddock arrived at the seller's home in Mesa \"very well-dressed, very well-groomed, very polite, very respectful,\" Haig said.\n\"At no time did I see anything suspicious or odd or any kind of a tell, anything that would set off an alarm,\" he said.\nHaig also said that he received death threats after his name was revealed this week.\nHe stressed that his sale made \"no contribution\" to the killings since Paddock didn't appear to have fired tracer rounds.\n\"I hope today ends (the death threats) when people realize that I wasn't in collusion with Paddock -- that I was not in any way, shape or form associated with the horrible crime that he committed,\" Haig said.\nTimeline of sales\nHaig said he sold 720

Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Man who sold Vegas shooter ammo speaks out 01:00\nHe held Friday's news conference to protect his reputation, he and his attorney said.\nThey gave the following timeline:\n\u2022 Paddock first approached Haig's table at a Las Vegas gun show sometime last year but met another person who was behind the table.\n\u2022 Haig first met Paddock at a subsequent Phoenix gun show, where he was selling ammunition.\n\u2022 Paddock took Haig's business card because the seller didn't have the quantity of trace ammunition that he wanted.\n\u2022 Paddock later called Haig three times to arrange a sale at Haig's home.\n\u2022 In September, Paddock arrived at Haig's home, bought the tracer ammunition and drove away.\nThe ammunition, he said, was:\n\u2022 600 rounds of 7.62mm NATO, M62, tracer ammunition, manufactured by the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Independence, Missouri.\n\u2022 120 rounds of 5.56mm M196 tracer ammunition, manufactured by the same plant.\nHe said the 5.56mm rounds were in their original packaging.\nHe did not comment on the 7.62mm rounds' packaging.\nBefore the sale, Paddock told him \"that he was going to go out to the desert and put on a light show\" with the ammunition -- that he was \"going to go out and shoot it at night with friends.\"\nSeller's reaction to massacre: 'Revulsion'\nVictor said police found his client's name and address on a box that Paddock had -- a box that Haig gave him to carry the tracer rounds he had bought.\nHaig said he learned of the massacre when authorities contacted him at work the next morning.\n\"Revulsion,\" Haig said of his reaction.\n\"Sickness.\nHorror that this man would do something like that.\"\nHaig spoke with investigators four times after the shooting, and has been \"fully cooperative,\" Victor said.\n\"This was a routine transaction to purchase a routine type of ammunition that is available in many different retail outlets throughout the state of Arizona,\" Victor said.\n\"After that transaction, Doug had absolutely no further contact with Mr.\nPaddock.\"\nDeath threats\nHaig said he's received death threats since the search warrant documents were released Tuesday.\n\"One woman (was) screaming through my door that I should be killed and I should die,\" he told reporters at Friday's news conference.\n\"It's been not a lot of fun, quite frankly.\"\nHaig added, \"I had no contribution to what Paddock did.\nI had no way to see into his mind.\"\nHaig named as person of interest\nA Nevada judge on Tuesday unsealed police search warrant records -- prepared shortly after the shooting -- that mentioned two persons of interest in the case.\nThe judge released the documents after CNN and other media outlets sued to obtain them.\nOne person of interest, whom police had named previously, was the killer's girlfriend, Marilou Danley.\nAuthorities subsequently cleared her publicly.\nThe second name was redacted.\nBut the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported it had a version of the search warrant that named, without redaction, Haig as that second person.\nThe documents didn't explain why he was a person of interest.\nLas Vegas police officials told CNN the department couldn't comment on Haig or any names, and referred questions to federal authorities.\nSheriff has said feds were investigating someone\nWhen the search warrant documents were released this week, Clark County District Court Judge Elissa Cadish allowed a small portion of those records to be redacted because \"there is an ongoing investigation regarding charges against another individual, arising out of information obtained in connection with the ... shooting, but not directly related to the shooting.\"\nIn response to a question from CNN in January, the Clark County sheriff, Joe Lombardo, said federal authorities are investigating a person in the case.\nThat person could face federal charges not directly related to the shooting within the next 60 days, the sheriff said January 19.\nLombardo didn't disclose the person's name, saying those details were \"under federal grand jury disclosure\" rules.\nOn Friday morning, before his arrest, Haig answered a reporter's question about whether he believed he was that person.\n\"No.\nI don't think it's me at all,\" Haig said.\n", ["Thought-terminating_Cliches", "Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_fear-prejudice", "Doubt"]],

\u2014His Excellency Marian Eleganti, auxiliary bishop of Chur in Switzerland, today added his name to the \u201cProfession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage,\u201d bringing the total number of signatories to eight bishops and one cardinal, LifeSite has confirmed.\nBishop Eleganti\u2019s support of the profession comes just three days after Bishop Athanasius Schneider, auxiliary of Astana, Kazakstan, invited the world\u2019s bishops to sign the document and join in raising a common voice in defense of the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage.\n\u201cGod decides the time, and the time will come when the Pope and the episcopacy again will proclaim, with all clarity, unambiguity and beauty, the sanctity of marriage, and of the family, and of the Eucharist,\u201d Schneider told LifesiteNews in an exclusive Jan. 15 interview.\nRaising a Common Voice\nIn conversation with LifeSiteNews, Schneider said greater public support of the document from the world\u2019s 5,000 bishops would be \u201ca stronger voice for professing the constant truths of the Church, and it would be a beautiful common voice defending the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage in the midst of a real neo-pagan society where divorce has become a plague and where sexual depravity is increasingly spreading.\u201d\nThe Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage was issued by three Kazakh Ordinaries, including Bishop Schneider, in early January.\nIn the document, the three bishops solemnly professed the Church\u2019s received teaching and discipline regarding sacramental marriage and the limited conditions (see Familiaris Consortio, n. 84) under which Catholics who are divorced and \u201cremarried\u201d may receive sacramental absolution and Holy Communion.\nThey presented their profession \u201cbefore God who will judge us,\u201d in response to certain pastoral norms issued by several bishops\u2019 conferences aimed at implementing chapter 8 of Pope Francis\u2019 apostolic exhortation on the family, Amoris Laetitia.\nSome of these norms, Schneider told LifeSiteNews, give \u201cimplicit approval\u201d of divorce and of sexual activity outside a valid marriage.\nSuch a reading is causing \u201crampant confusion,\u201d will spread \u201ca plague of divorce\u201d in the Church, and is \u201calien\u201d to the Church\u2019s entire faith and Tradition, the three bishops said in the profession.\n\u201cThis is contrary to Divine Revelation,\u201d Schneider further told LifeSite, adding that the \u201cbeautiful explanations\u201d that are being presented to clergy and faithful as \u201cdiscernment\u201d and \u201cpastoral accompaniment,\u201d or a \u201cchange of paradigm\u201d and \u201cdiscovery of the subjective part of the truth,\u201d when translated into \u201ccommon sense language,\u201d are tantamount to an allowance to sin.\n\u201cOur conscience as bishops calls to us to do this,\u201d Schneider explained.\n\u201cWe were forced by our conscience, in the conscience of the Successors of the Apostles and colleagues of the Pope.\u201d\nAs Successors of the Apostles, Schneider said they \u201ccould not act in another way.\u201d\nBishop Marian Eleganti\nThe profession\u2019s most recent signatory, Bishop Marian Eleganti, O.S.B., is a monk of the abbey of the Missionary Benedictines in St. Otmarsberg in Uznach, located in the canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland.\nHe was ordained to the priesthood on June 23, 1995.\nIn July 1999, the monks of St. Otmarsberg Abbey (the youngest abbey in Switzerland) elected Eleganti the second abbot of the monastery.\nThe Missionary Benedictines in Uznach belong to the Benedictine Congregation of St. Ottilien near Munich, with branches in Europe, East, West and South Africa, South America, Cuba and the USA, India, Korea, China, Kazakhstan and the Philippines.\nIn 2009, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Abbot Marian Eleganti as auxiliary bishop of the diocese of Chur, Switzerland.\nHe was ordained a bishop on Jan. 31, 2010.\nSince 2011, Bishop Eleganti has served as the Swiss Youth Bishop for German-speaking Switzerland on behalf of the Swiss Bishops\u2019 Conference, and as vicar for religious and monastic communities.\nHe is also the vicar for the philosophical-theological education and ongoing formation and training of pastoral workers.\nBishop Marian Eleganti\u2019s public support of the Profession of Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage brings the number of signatories to nine.\nTo date, in addition to the three original signatories from Kazakstan, the following prelates have signed the profession: Cardinal Janis Pujats, Emeritus Archbishop Metropolitan of Riga, Latvia; Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2, former apostolic nuncio to the United States; His Excellency Luigi Negri, Archbishop emeritus of Ferrara-Comacchio, Italy; Bishop Andreas Laun, Emeritus Auxiliary of Salzburg, Austria; and His

conspiracy theories after he sold ammunition to the Las Vegas mass shooter.\nDouglas Haig, a 55-year-old Honeywell engineer, sold more than 700 rounds of ammunition to Las Vegas mass murderer Stephen Paddock in September.\nHaig's name was inadvertently revealed this week when unredacted court documents were released to reporters.\nSearch warrant records showed that Haig was a person of interest in the investigation of the mass shooting.\nAs a result, Haig said that he has received death threats and people have pounded on his door to tell him that he deserves to die.\n\"It makes me feel horrible,\" he said at a news conference Friday morning.\n\"People need to do their research and think rather than just react viscerally.\u201d\nIt's not just people harassing Haig at his home: Conspiracy theorists online have seized on Haig's engineering background to lob wild claims about the Las Vegas shooting.\nMany of their theories lean heavily on Haig's LinkedIn profile, which says that Haig previously worked for Boeing and Northrop Grumman.\nBonkers conspiracy site Intellihub posted an article this week that pointed to Haig's background in the aerospace industry as a sign of U.S. government involvement in the massacre.\nThey noted Haig's LinkedIn page, which says he worked for Boeing in Mesa as a senior liaison engineer in their unmanned helicopter division from 2010 to 2013.\n\"Let\u2019s not forget that it is a fact that helicopters were lurking behind the Mandalay Bay during the attack which were not shown on the radar,\" author Shepard Ambellas writes.\nAmbellas claims helicopters provided an \"air assault\" during the massacre, a ludicrous theory he's expounded upon on InfoWars with the internet's conspiracy-theorist-in-chief Alex Jones.\nAmbellas and Intellihub claim that the FBI and the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department are providing cover for the real story behind the massacre, with help from Haig.\nIn public statements this week, Haig denied any connection to the massacre and said he merely sold Paddock the rounds.\n\"However, don\u2019t be fooled,\" Intellihub writes.\n\"Haig is likely a CIA cut-out who is just upholding the public narrative in conjunction with the FBI Las Vegas and the LVMPD.\"\nLaura Loomer, a noxious far-right personality who formerly worked for Project Veritas, also started making hay with Haig's

officer.\nIt should be noted that Haig's rounds were probably not even used in the massacre: Haig sold Paddock tracer ammunition, which emit a flare when fired making them easier to see.\nHad Paddock fired these rounds during the nighttime massacre at the concert, they would have been visible.\nHaig's attorney Marc Victor told reporters it was perfectly legal for Haig, a private citizen, to sell Paddock hundreds of rounds of tracer ammunition \u2014 the bullets are legal in Arizona.\nPaddock showed up to buy ammunition at Haig's home after meeting him at a gun show in Phoenix.\n\"I sold him 600 rounds of .308 tracer, surplus U.S. military.\nI sold him 120 rounds of .556 tracer, again, surplus U.S. military,\" Haig said to ABC15.\n\"I put it in a box for him.\nHe paid me, put it in his car, and left.\"\nHaig said he's been legally selling ammunition as as a hobby since 1991, but after the massacre, he has stopped his side business.\nIt wasn't unusual for a customer to buy over 700 rounds, he said.\n\"I've seen all kinds of people.\nThere were no tells,\" Haig said of Paddock.\nWhen asked about the threats, Haig said, \u201cI\u2019ve had people screaming they want me to die through my front door.\"\nHaig and his attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the conspiracy theorizing.\nHaig said he's sorry that the massacre took place, but emphasized that he had nothing to do with Paddock's mass shooting.\n\u201cI had no contribution to what Paddock did,\u201d Haig said at the news conference.\n\u201cI had no way to see into his mind.\nThe product that I sold him had absolutely nothing to do with what he did.\u201d\nNevertheless, it's hard to believe that Haig's denials will dissuade the conspiracy-mongers.\nYouTube conspiracy theorist Jake

2017.\n(Reuters photo: Giorgio Perottino)\nIn a debate, Ross Douthat and Massimo Faggioli discussed Pope Francis\u2019s legacy and its effect on internal Church controversies.\nOn Wednesday night, New York Times columnist Ross Douthat and Villanova professor of theology Massimo Faggioli came together for a debate entitled \u201cFrancis @ Five: Assessing the Legacy of Pope Francis Five Years after His Election.\u201d As I made my way up to Fordham University, I was excited.\nHaving followed Douthat and Faggioli\u2019s ongoing dialogue on Twitter, I knew I was in for a lively, if predictable, conversation.\nIn his opening remarks, Douthat laid out three criteria that can be used to evaluate Francis\u2019s papacy thus far: his impact on the public\u2019s perception of the Church (a success); his attempts at reforming the Vatican bureaucracy (a disappointment); and his position on \u201cmoral-theological controversies,\u201d specifically, communion for the divorced and remarried (a problem).\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nFaggioli, meanwhile, outlined a genuinely surprising position.\nRather than making a straightforward case for why Pope Francis has changed the Church for the better, Faggioli rejected the possibility of evaluating his papacy in terms of \u201ccontinuity\u201d with past popes, since doing so would assume that \u201cChristianity at some point .\n.\n.\nwas complete,\u201d which Faggioli does not think is true.\nWhile I emphatically disagree with this argument, I have to hand it to Faggioli: From the outset, he made clear that he was not planning to debate Douthat on the implications of the Francis papacy.\nInstead, through a combination of rhetorical tricks and soft-peddled Hegelianism, he would completely redefine the role and nature of the Catholic Church.\nDuring the crux of the debate \u2014 the discussion of communion for the divorced and remarried \u2014 Faggioli raised his most theologically unsettling point.\nTo defend his position that remarried persons should be able to receive communion, Faggioli invoked the case of Germany, where 50 percent of Catholic marriages end in divorce.\nFor Faggioli, the implication is that at least 50 percent of German Catholic children never see their parents receive communion and lose their faith because of it.\nThis, he says, is \u201cbad for evangelization,\u201d and in order to keep the pews full, the Church\u2019s role should not be to deny communion to the divorced and remarried, but instead to ask, \u201cWhat can the Catholic Church do to make the faithful able to receive sacraments?\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThis is a lovely suggestion, and one that I\u2019m not entirely unsympathetic to.\nHowever, the fact remains that Faggioli is suggesting the Church do much more than provide sacraments to the faithful.\nJust before invoking the German case, Faggioli characterized the country as one of the most secular in the world.\nBut rather than lamenting what secularism has wrought on marital life in Germany, reasserting the Church\u2019s position on marriage, and insisting that the faithful strive to live according to her laws, Faggioli argues that the Church ought to bend to the will of secular society.\nAdvertisement\nIt should be clear to anyone, not just practicing Catholics, that this is absurd.\nIf the Church exists simply to accommodate the whims and failures of secular modernity, then what is the point of the Church?\nPope Benedict XVI has warned against precisely the kind of \u201caccommodation\u201d Faggioli is calling for, writing that when \u201cthe people cannot cope\u201d with God, they \u201cbring him down into their own world,\u201d and insist that \u201che must be the kind of God that [they need].\u201d In other words, \u201cMan is using God, and, in reality, even if it is not outwardly discernible, he is placing himself above God.\u201d To fully drive the point home, Benedict equates this kind of worship with the Israelites desert worship of the bull calf.\nUnsurprisingly, this progressive interpretation of Catholic doctrine eventually reveals itself to be rank historicism.\nThroughout the debate, Faggioli drew out the argument that allowing the remarried to receive communion would not represent a radical change in doctrine but a return to the teachings of the Gospel.\nEventually, Douthat drew his argument to its logical conclusion with this question: Were priests throughout history in fact misleading their divorced and remarried parishioners by telling them they could not receive communion?\nAfter a few seconds\u2019 pause, Faggioli gave the only answer he could: \u201cThere are different responses to the same question in different times.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThroughout their conversation, both Douthat and Faggioli repeatedly observed that the debate over Pope Francis and the future of the Church is carried on primarily among Catholic intellectuals, unbeknownst to most of \u201cthe flock.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nIt strikes me, however, that everybody \u2014 Catholic or not \u2014 has a dog in this fight, which is about more than communion and canon law.\nAt its core, this debate is about truth and our ability to judge right from wrong.\nCould we possibly say, for instance, that it\u2019s impossible to judge the presidency of Donald Trump relative to past presidents?\nOf course not \u2014 that would be preposterous, as I\u2019m sure Faggioli would agree.\nTo pass moral judgements on papacies, presidencies, or anything else, we must have recourse to truth, and to the institutions that have upheld this truth for centuries.\nWhether in the Church or in the academy, we must resist this dangerous historicist impulse.\nIf we don\u2019t, we will find ourselves, in the words of Pope Benedict, in \u201ca dictatorship of relativism that does not recognize anything as definitive and whose ultimate goal consists solely of one\u2019s own ego and desires.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nREAD MORE:\nA Defense of the Catholic Tradition\nThe Left\u2019s New Plan to Gut Religious-Liberty Protections\nWhat\u2019s At Stake in the Fight For Religious

Democratic Party promotes itself as an advocacy group for all matters concerning homosexuals and labels politicians, who take stances opposite theirs on politically charged issues such as same-sex marriage, as bigots.\nYet, the party keeps on inviting an imam, who has a long record of hostility toward homosexuals, to participate at its annual functions.\nThis blatant hypocrisy shows the political bankruptcy of their leadership\u2019s claims to be pro-gay and anti-bigotry and reveals their intention to pander to those in the Muslim community who spew intolerance and would wish others harm.\nOn Saturday, October 7, 2017, the Palm Beach Democratic Party held its 2017 Truman Kennedy Johnson (TKJ) Dinner at the West Palm Beach Marriott Hotel, in West Palm Beach, Florida.\nThe Keynote Speaker at the event was Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe.\nOther speakers included: United States Representative Alcee Hastings; then-Florida Democratic Party Chairman Stephen Bittel, who resigned in November over allegations of sexually inappropriate behavior; and then-Palm Beach County Party Chairwoman Terrie Rizzo, who was elected in December to take over for Bittel as Chair of the Florida Democratic Party.\nPrior to the speakers, there was a joint invocation performed by a rabbi, two pastors and an imam.\nThe imam, Maulana Shafayat Mohamed, is notorious for his unapologetic vilification of homosexuals.\nShafayat Mohamed is the imam of the Darul Uloom Institute, located in Pembroke Pines, Florida.\nThe mosque has been a haven for terror-related individuals and activity.\n\u201cDirty Bomber\u201d Jose Padilla was a student of Shafayat Mohamed\u2019s at Darul Uloom.\nNow-deceased al-Qaeda Global Operations Chief, Adnan el-Shukrijumah, was a prayer leader at Darul Uloom.\nAnd Darul Uloom Arabic teacher Imran Mandhai, along with mosque goers Hakki Aksoy and Shueyb Mossa Jokhan, hatched a plot at the mosque to blow up different South Florida structures, including area power stations, Jewish businesses, and a National Guard armory.\nWhile terrorism plays a huge role in his mosque\u2019s history \u2013 and he has been around for all of it \u2013 Shafayat Mohamed\u2019s personal history deals much more in bigotry than terror.\nOne stop on Shafayat Mohamed\u2019s Facebook page and one can view his profile photo of him holding a dark green book with gold border and letters on the cover.\nThe book is \u201cThe Meaning of THE HOLY QUR\u2019AN,\u201d a version of the Quran that was banned by the Los Angeles public school system, in February 2002, for containing numerous anti-Semitic commentaries.\nIn it, Jews are described as: \u201carrogant,\u201d \u201cjealous,\u201d \u201cselfish,\u201d \u201cspiteful,\u201d \u201cgreedy,\u201d \u201ccursed,\u201d \u201capes and swine,\u201d and \u201cunder divine displeasure.\u201d\nThis may seem an innocent mistake on the imam\u2019s part, but his actions against the gay community and sinister views are anything but.\nIn February 2005, an article written by Shafayat Mohamed was published on the Darul Uloom website, entitled \u2018Tsunami: Wrath of God.\u2019 In it, he claims that gay sex caused the 2004 Indonesian tsunami and that most Jews and Christians, whom he refers to as \u201cPeople of the Book,\u201d are \u201cperverted transgressors.\u201d\nIt is writings such as these that have gotten Shafayat Mohamed thrown off a number of Broward County boards.\nEven so, the imam has been unrepentant.\nIn a speech he gave at Darul Uloom, in August 2015, titled \u2018Quraan Torah Bible Forbid Man Marrying Man,\u2019 he admitted that he \u201cgot sacked from many [county] boards, because there were a lot of gay people who said, \u2018We don\u2019t want him on that board.\u2019\u201d He said he had a choice, to \u201csit in Paradise or\u2026 sit on the board and go to Hell.\u201d\nHe began his speech by attacking President Barack Obama for supporting same-sex marriage.\nHe asked the following, \u201cDid you hear what President Obama said?\u2026 Do you know what a sad situation we are in this country?...\nHere you have the President of the United States of America saying that a man could marry a man?\u2026 Are we sleeping?\nDo you believe in the Quran?\nAre we gonna sit and have the Quran be ridiculed?\u201d He then cited the Christian and Jewish Bible, barking loudly, \u201cThe Bible says that if a man sleeps with a man, he should be killed!\u201d\nShafayat Mohamed later lamented the existence of Muslim homosexuals.\nHe decried, \u201cListen.\nDon\u2019t deny it.\nThey already got Muslim gay communities.\u201d He as well spoke of his support for polygamy, an act that is illegal in the United States.\nHe exclaimed, \u201cHere the President says a man can marry a man, but you can\u2019t say a man can have four wives\u2026!\u201d\nThe October TKJ Dinner was not the first Democrat event Shafayat Mohamed has participated in.\nIn fact, he has been involved in many, including giving the invocations at the Florida Democratic Party\u2019s annual Leadership Blue Gala in 2014 (featuring Bill Clinton), 2015 and 2016.\nAnd given that this author has written about this before, the October event will probably not be the last occasion that he is embraced by the Democratic Party.\nShafayat Mohamed is not the only Muslim extremist that has participated in the Democratic Party\u2019s TKJ Dinner.\nIn October 2015, the dinner invocation was performed by Wilfredo Amr Ruiz, the legal adviser of the American Muslim Association of North America (AMANA), a group that actively promotes former KKK leader and white supremacist David Duke.\nRuiz, as well, founded AMANA\u2019s Connecticut and Puerto Rico chapters.\nIn July 2010, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned Ruiz\u2019s AMANA for posting what the ADL called a \u201cvenomous\u201d anti-Semitic Duke video onto the group\u2019s official website.\nAMANA is currently promoting another anti-Semitic Duke-produced video, on the AMANA site.\nThe President of AMANA, Sofian Zakkout, has referred to Duke as \u201cDavid Duke, a man to believe in!\u201d\nBy inviting people like Shafayat Mohamed, an avowed enemy of the gay community, and Wilfredo Ruiz, whose group promotes white supremacists, to participate in its functions, the Democratic Party has effectively revealed its disregard for the concerns of those it disingenuously claims to advocate for and protect.\nIt is time for Democrats to reject the bigotry of these radicals and see them for

row\nA victim of a paedophile priest in Chile has revealed he wrote to the Pope in 2015 about an alleged cover-up after Francis denied getting evidence.\nJuan Carlos Cruz, a victim of cleric Fernando Karadima in the 1980s, accused fellow priest Juan Barros of witnessing the abuse and doing nothing.\nThe Pope caused outrage after a visit to Chile last month by defending Bishop Barros, who was made a bishop in 2015.\nThe Vatican refused to comment on the letter when approached by BBC News.\nPope Francis has said in the past that dealing with abuse is vital for the Church's credibility and perpetrators must face \"sanctions\".\nWhat allegations does the letter make?\nMr Cruz sent the text of his letter (written in Spanish) to BBC News, showing it was addressed personally to Pope Francis and dated 3 March 2015.\nThat was more than two weeks before the bishop's ordination in the south Chilean city of Osorno, an event dramatically disrupted by hundreds of protesters accusing Bishop Barros of covering up Karadima's sex attacks on young boys.\nThe bishop has denied ever knowing about \"the serious abuses\" committed by Karadima, who was never prosecuted in Chile because so much time had passed but was convicted and sentenced by the Vatican to a lifetime of \"penance and prayer\".\n\"Holy Father, I decided to write this letter to you because I'm tired of fighting, crying and suffering,\" Mr Cruz writes.\n\u00a9 AFP Cardinal O'Malley (centre) accompanied the Pope in Latin America\n\"Our story is well known and there's no point reminding you of it, except to tell you of the horror of having experienced this abuse and how I wanted to kill myself.\"\nIn his letter, he also attaches the full text of a previous letter written a month earlier to the Vatican's top diplomat in Chile, Archbishop Ivo Scapolo.\nIn that letter, Mr Cruz accuses Bishop Barros of \"doing all the dirty work of Fernando Karadima\", and describes the abuse he suffered and which Bishop Barros allegedly witnessed.\n\"When we were in a room with Karadima and Juan Barros, if he [Barros] wasn't kissing Karadima, he watched as one of us, the youngest, was touched by Karadima and forced to give him kisses,\" he writes.\n\"Karadima would say to me: 'Put your mouth next to mine and stick out your tongue.'\nHe'd stick out his and kiss us with his tongue.\nJuan Barros witnessed all of this on countless occasions, not just in my case but in the case of others as well.\"\nAddressing himself to Pope Francis, Mr Cruz says: \"Holy Father, Juan Barros says he saw nothing and yet, there are dozens of us who can testify to the fact that not only was he present when Karadima abused us, but that he, too, kissed Karadima and they touched each other.\"\nHe concludes the letter with this appeal: \"Please Holy Father, don't be like the others.\nThere are so many of us who despite everything think that you can do something.\nI treasure my faith, it's what sustains me, but it is slipping away from me.\"\nHasn't the Pope already apologised?\n\u00a9 AFP Karadima was only punished by the Vatican\nThe remarks that the Pope had made in January that caused such offence were: \"The day they bring me proof against Bishop Barros, then I will speak.\nThere is not a single piece of proof against him.\nEverything is slander.\nIs this clear?\"\nThe Pope later apologised for hurting victims' feelings \"without meaning to\" but continued to insist there was \"no evidence\" against the bishop.\n\"In Barros's case, it was studied,\" he said.\n\"It was restudied.\nAnd there is no evidence...\nI don't have evidence to convict.\"\nHow far did the letter get?\n\u00a9 Reuters Bishop Barros (centre) was greeted by angry protesters at his ordination\nMembers of the Pope's own Commission for the Protection of Minors, set up in 2014 as part of efforts to counter sex abuse by clergy, have told the Associated Press they hand-delivered the letter to Francis's top adviser on sex abuse, Cardinal Sean O'Malley, in April 2015.\nA photo in the AP report shows Marie Collins, a member of the commission at the time, handing the letter to the cardinal.\n\"When we gave him the letter for the Pope, he assured us he would give it to the Pope and speak of the concerns,\" she told AP.\n\"And at a later date, he assured us that that had been done.\"\nMr Cruz told the BBC that Cardinal O'Malley had called him later in 2015 to say he had given the letter to the Pope.\nCardinal O'Malley, whose spokesman referred requests for comment to the Vatican, has earned respect for his work in tackling sex abuse by clergy in Boston.\nCardinal O'Malley's disgraced predecessor, the late Cardinal Bernard Law, had moved paedophile priests between parishes rather than addressing victims' claims.\nIn an unusual step, Cardinal O'Malley openly criticised the Pope last month for his initial remarks in Chile, saying he had left victims feeling abandoned.\nPope Francis announced last week he was sending the Vatican's top expert on sexual abuse, Archbishop Charles Scicluna, to Chile to investigate the accusations against Bishop Barros.\n", ["Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling,Labeling",

Monday.\nBishop Fischer is the tenth prelate to sign the profession.\nAs has been widely reported, three bishops in Kazakhstan \u2013 Tomash Peta, Jan Pawel Lenga, and Athanasius Schneider \u2013 issued a Profession of the Immutable Truths about Sacramental Marriage on Dec. 31, 2017.\nThe profession was made public on Jan. 2, 2018.\nIn the document, the three bishops solemnly professed the Church\u2019s received teaching and discipline regarding sacramental marriage and the limited conditions (see Familiaris Consortio, n. 84) under which Catholics who are civilly divorced and joined in a second union may receive sacramental absolution and Holy Communion.\nOrdained to the priesthood in 1961, Fischer headed the Marriage and Family Centre of the Feldkirch diocese from 1979 to 1990.\nAfter serving as vicar general of the diocese from 1989, in 2005 Pope Benedict XVI appointed him bishop of Felkirch where he served until 2011, retiring at the age of 75.\nBishop Fischer\u2019s support of the profession comes one week after Bishop Athanasius Schneider, auxiliary of Astana, Kazakstan, invited the world\u2019s bishops to sign the document and join in raising a common voice in defense of the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage.\n\u201cGod decides the time, and the time will come when the Pope and the episcopacy again will proclaim, with all clarity, unambiguity and beauty, the sanctity of marriage, and of the family, and of the Eucharist,\u201d Schneider told LifesiteNews in an exclusive Jan. 15 interview.\nSchneider said greater public support of the document from the world\u2019s 5,000 bishops would be \u201ca stronger voice for professing the constant truths of the Church, and it would be a beautiful common voice defending the sanctity and the indissolubility of marriage in the midst of a real neo-pagan society where divorce has become a plague and where sexual depravity is increasingly spreading.\u201d\nBishop Fischer\u2019s public support

unleash on the Church.\nI\u2019m posting the address here because I'm convinced the Archbishop\u2019s words provide recent recruits to Tradition with vital historical context for the diabolical debacle that is the pontificate of Pope Francis.\nAnd for those of us who\u2019ve been in the trenches for a long, long time it also provides welcome reminder of why we must continue to fight.\nEven though I personally was in attendance back in 1976 when Archbishop Lefebvre delivered this address in Minneapolis, I was only ten years old and of course didn't realize how prophetic he was on that occasion, or how devastated by the Second Vatican Council, the New Mass, and the Freemasonic infiltration of the Vatican.\nIn fact, this transcript reads like a message of encouragement at a crucial

eleventh-hour defence of the Kingship of Christ (ignored completely by the Second Vatican Council) and a desperate last stand for Tradition, the infallible teachings of Mother Church and of course her ancient liturgy.\nAnd now that Pope Francis has inadvertently unmasked the true spirit of Vatican II, it becomes obvious how and why those who resisted that spirit were right to have done so and will certainly be hailed by history as the heroic band of Catholic brothers that mounted the twentieth century\u2019s last stand for Christ the King and, while scorned and mocked at the time, were nevertheless totally vindicated fifty years later.\nMay we continue to earn the right to stand with them today.\nMJM\nThe Archbishop Speaks\nLadies and Gentlemen:\nAs I said to Mr. [Walter] Matt, I

the Church.\u201d I am out of communion with the Church because I continue the Tradition of the Church?\nThis is possible?\nI do not understand.\nWhy?\nI have done nothing.\nI believe nothing other

refused, because I refuse to contribute to the destruction of the Church.\nBecause now they are destroying the Church.\nWhen I die and go before the judge, God will not be able to say to me, \u201cYou

Church.\nAnd so I said to Mgr.\nBenelli, \u201cNo, I will not sign that writing.\u201d\nI think that the mutation in the Church came in through the Second Vatican Council.\nAnd do you think this change in the Church came suddenly?\nWhen, then?\nAt the beginning of the Council?\nNo, this change in the Church began one century before [the Council].\nPope Pius VI said during the French Revolution that if the Church continues to remain under the influence of the prince of the revolution, then, in the future a crisis will come upon the Church.\nIn [1844], Pope Pius IX ordered Cardinal Rigoli to publish the Instructions of the Carbonari.\n[3] The Pope himself asked Cardinal Rigoli to publish the Instructions of the Carbonari.\nAnd what did these Instructions say?\nThe Instructions said that they [the Carbonari/Freemasons] must begin to fight against the Church by bringing reform into the Church.\nThe Instructions said the infiltration will take perhaps not one year, perhaps not ten years, but perhaps a century.\nThe Carbonari must enter into the seminary, into the convent, into the sacristy, and slowly, very slowly, the priests will have the ideals of the revolution; of the Freemasons.\nOne day these priests, imbued with Masonic principles, will become bishops, and these bishops can then choose a pope.\nAnd even if the pope is not a Freemason, he will have the same ideals as the Freemasons.\nPope Pius IX called for the publishing of these Instructions in order to warn the bishops and priests of those times of the fight against the church.\nIn 1895, the Catholic Antonia Fogazzaro, a known modernist, founded a masonic lodge in Milan.\nHe wrote in his book, Il Santo, that \u201cWe [modernists]\u2026want a reform in the Church\u2026without rebellion, carried out by legitimate authority\u2026even if this takes 20, 30, or 50 years.\u201d[4] \u201cThe reform will have to be brought about in the name of obedience.\u201d The modernist ideas in the Church introduced and enacted through obedience!\nAnd I think\u2026well, here we are!\nIn this time!\nThe reform is here, and it is brought about through obedience, to the Council, to the bishop, to the priest.\nAnd all they say is \u201cObedience, obedience, obedience.\u201d\nThe Instructions of the Carbonari say the bishop and the priest will think that they are following the tiara of the Pope, but they will be following the flag of Freemasonry [\u201cthe banner of revolution\u201d].\nThey said that.\nThey wrote that!\nOne century before [the Council]!\nThus, it is very important to know that they prepared for the beginning of the Second Vatican Council for a century, perhaps two centuries!\nAs the Archbishop of Dakar and President of the Episcopal Commission for French-speaking West Africa, I was appointed member of the Central Preparatory Commission of the Second Vatican Council.\nThere were some seventy cardinals, twenty bishops, and four super-authorities of the religious orders, among others.\nBefore the last meeting of this Commission the members received two schemas on the same subject: one from Cardinal Ottaviani and another from Cardinal Bea.\nThe schema from Cardinal Ottaviani was titled \u201c\u2026On Religious Tolerance\u201d and the other, from Cardinal Bea, was titled \u201cOn Religious Freedom [Liberty].\u201d When we read these two schemas, we thought, \u201cThis is impossible.\nHow is it we can receive two opposing theses?\nOne says we must not tolerate error.\nThe other says that error has the right to exist in the name of the dignity of the human person.\u201d And so, we go into the meeting.\nCardinal Ottaviani, standing, says to Cardinal Bea, \u201cYou have no authority to compose this schema, because it is a theological thesis and therefore within the competence of the Theological Commission.\u201d As Cardinal Bea stands up, he says, \u201cI do have the right to compose this schema because if anything concerns Christian Unity it is religious liberty, and I am the President of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity.\u201d Cardinal Bea, addressing Cardinal Ottaviani, further said, \u201cI am opposed to your schema.\u201d\nImpossible!\nWe were in a very sad, serious situation.\nCardinal Ruffini had to intervene as we were in front of two cardinals, our brothers.\nHe said we must wait for the authority to say who is right and who is wrong.\nBut before the Pope came (because the Pope came many times to present at these meetings) we voted on the schema.\nWho is with Cardinal Ottaviani?\nWho is with Cardinal Bea?\nThe conservatives and the liberals.\nAs the last meeting of the Preparatory Commission, it was for me the first image of the future Council.\nThis historic address appeared for the first time ever in a print edition of The Remnant last year.\nIsn't it time for you to subscribe?\nAnd as we go into the Council, you know that on the first day of the Council, Cardinal Lienart was the chief of the liberal cardinals in the Council, [together] with all of the Cardinals of the Rhine (such as Cardinal Alfrink, Cardinal Frings, Cardinal Dopfner, Cardinal Suenens, Cardinal Leinart, and Cardinal Koenig of Austria).\nAnd now one month ago in Rome, the traditional periodical Chiesa Viva published a photo of Cardinal Lienart with all of the appurtenances of Freemasonry, the date of his inscription in Masonry, the date [of his rising to] the 20th Degree of Freemasonry, the date [of his rising to] the 30th Degree of Freemasonry, and the places where he [attended] the meetings of Freemasonry.\nThis Cardinal was the chief of the liberals in the Council.\nThat is my cardinal; he ordained me to the priesthood, and he consecrated me a bishop.\nAnd now this is public.\nNobody has been able to refute the publication.\nAnd so, we have (I am confident) a mutation in the church by the Council and by the reform after the Council.\nNow, some say the Council is (was) good, but only the reforms were bad.\nThat is not true.\nWhy?\nBecause when the reforms come, Rome always says the reforms are being done in the name of the Council.\nIn the name of the Council!\nIt is evident that all of the reforms came from the Council.\nAnd if the reforms are bad, then it is impossible that the Council is good and all the reforms are bad, because that is the authentic interpretation of the Council by Rome.\nRome said in the name of the Declaration of Liturgy, we [implement] the liturgical reform.\nWe can say that [these bad changes are] not in the text of the Declaration, but this man has the authority to say that this is from the Council.\nThey know that.\nAnd I am sure that it [the mutation] is in the Council.\nEven if it is not explicitly [stated] in the Council but [rather] in the spirit of the Council, it is the same!\nFor example, with religious freedom: now the Holy See and all the Nuncios are against the Catholic State in the name of the Council - in the name of the Declaration of Religious Freedom.\nI have heard this (personally) twice.\nThe first time I was in Columbia.\nWhen I was in Columbia, I read in the paper about the change in the first article of the Constitution of the Republic of Columbia.\n[The first article] stated that only the Republic of Columbia recognizes only the Catholic religion.\nThey changed it.\nThey removed this article.\nI read the discourse of the President of Columbia with the Nuncios of Columbia and the Secretary of the Episcopal Conference in Columbia.\nThe President said he is very, very anxious.\nHe said to the people, \u201ceven though we remove this article we remain Catholic.\nI am a Catholic, I shall remain Catholic, and I do everything possible for the Council and the Catholics in our country.\u201d\nThen, the discourse of the Nuncio was the discourse of a Freemason: all of it was \u201cprogress,\u201d \u201chumanity,\u201d \u201cevolution,\u201d and all the hubris of a Freemason.\nAnd during the discourse of the Secretary of the Episcopal Conference, [the Secretary] said, \u201cin the name of the Declaration of Religious Freedom [of Vatican II], we ask the President to remove this article in the Constitution.\u201d\nI met this Secretary of the Episcopal Conference during my visit in Columbia, and he said for two years they [had been asking] the President, in the name of the Holy See, to change this article in their Constitution.\nBut I will never\u2026I do not accept the concept, because you destroy the Catholic State in the name of the Council.\nAre you sure?\nYes, sure.\nIt is evident.\nNow I said to the [Secretary], \u201cAs I speak with you now about Columbia, I know that you are the one responsible for the change in the constitution of Valais in Switzerland one year ago.\nThe change in the Constitution of Valais was the same.\u201d (Because you know Switzerland is a Federation where some states are Protestant and some states are Catholic.\nThe Valais is Catholic.\nAnd in its constitution, the words of the first article [of the constitution] of the State of Valais \u2013 Econe, where we are located, is in the State of Valais - only one religion is recognized: The Catholic Church.)\nAnd [the Secretary] said, \u201cYes, I am responsible for this change.\u201d Brother, what did you do with the Social Kingship of Christ?\nWhat is this for you?\nWhat do you say when you say \u201cthy kingdom come\u201d in your prayer, the Our Father?\n\u201cAh,\u201d the Nuncio said to me, \u201cNow it is impossible.\u201d What did you do with the encyclical of Pope Pius XI, Quas Primas?\n\u201cAh, but now the Pope cannot write an encyclical like Quas Primas.\u201d\nIt is incredible.\nAnd all in the name of the Council.\nWe must take care, because this change in the church is a liberal change.\nThe liberal principles have entered the Church now, and they destroy the Church.\nIf we cannot set out the true principles of the Church, if we in the name of religious freedom said that all religions have the same right in every state in the world\u2026\n[missing audio...]\nThe truth is the only one King of the World is Jesus Christ.\nWe say in the Gloria in Excelsis Deo, \u201cTu solus Altissimus,\u201d \u201cTu solus Dominus,\u201d \u201cYou alone are the Highest,\u201d \u201cYou alone are the Lord.\u201d But practically, we would refuse this Kingdom of Jesus Christ if we said that Luther, Mohammed, Buddha and Jesus Christ are all the same.\nWe cannot say that.\nImpossible.\nWe know that in many states (it is a pity) it is impossible [to recognize Catholicism as the state religion].\nWe must tolerate - have tolerance for the error - but never give the same right to error and truth.\nThat is impossible.\nAnd the change in the liturgy is very important.\nIt is very bad.\nOne of the principles of modern man, as they say now, \u201cmodern man,\u201d is democracy.\nAnd democracy can have a good sense but not if [by that term is meant] that those who govern receive their authority from the people.\nThe authority comes from God.\nNot from the people.\nNot from the masses.\nFrom God.\nBut today the principle, the democratic principle, is that the authority is in the people.\nIt is in the masses.\nThat is not true.\nIt is impossible.\nAnd our liturgy is the school of our Faith.\nIt is the first school of our Faith for all people.\nI was in Africa as a missionary and as bishop for 30 years.\nI know the liturgy was the best school of the Faith for people who cannot read.\nThey can see what the priest does.\nThey can see what the priest does at the adoration of the Body and the Blood of Jesus Christ.\nAnd they know that Jesus Christ is present - His real presence is on the altar - by the attitude of the priest.\nThey know that.\nThat is very important.\nBut the change in the Mass destroys the Church.\nBecause we know the liturgy teaches us hierarchy.\nThe true liturgy is hierarchical.\nIt is not democratic but hierarchical.\nWhy?\nBecause we have God, the priest, and then the people.\nThat is hierarchy.\nWhen we are in Church we know God is on the altar; the priest is between God and the people; and the people receive God at the hand of the priest.\nThat is hierarchy.\nBut now the new liturgy is more democratic - all around the table.\nThe priest is only the president, and sometimes another man can take the role of the president of the meal.\nThat is a new liturgy.\nThat is very bad, because we have no sense of the hierarchical; whereas the sense of hierarchy is very important in our life.\nWe need the authority of God.\nWe need the Real Presence of God on our altar.\nWe need the Sacrifice of the Mass \u2013 not a meal only \u2013 but the Sacrifice.\nSo, the Victim of the Sacrifice is really present on our altar.\nThat is the school of our Faith.\nAnd slowly, slowly, this new Mass equivocates.\nIt moves the minds of the faithful in a Protestant [direction].\nI do not say that all [Novus Ordo] Masses are invalid.\nI do not say that.\nBut perhaps, more and more, they become invalid because [the ministers lose faith in the Real Presence].\nRecently, in France, a progressive paper conducted a statistical survey to see how many priests no longer have faith in the Real Presence.\nThey found that twenty-two percent no longer have the faith, the belief in the Real Presence.\nBut I think that if they directed this question to all of the priests who are under 50 years of age, they would find that fifty percent [have lost the faith in the Real Presence], because the young priests have no faith.\nNo faith.\nLast year, Bishop Adam (in our Diocese of Sion, Switzerland) ordained one priest for my Congregation of the Holy Ghost Fathers.\nThis one priest came from France.\nHis uncle had died in a road accident when his cab fell in the river.\nThe uncle had nine children.\nThe Bishop said to the new priest, \u201cNow you can say Mass for your uncle.\nNow you are a priest, and you can say Mass for your uncle.\u201d The new priest said, \u201cNo, never.\u201d Why?\nIt is not useful to say Mass for the dead?\n\u201cNo, no, it is impossible.\nThey are already in heaven.\u201d This young priest who was ordained by the Bishop last year for my Congregation is now a professor in the minor seminary in Switzerland.\nThey are not learning theology, not philosophy, not anything.\nThey learn nothing now.\nAnother example.\nRecently, I had two young [potential] seminarians come to my house near Paris.\nOne of them works in a factory, and the other is a university student.\nThey told me they were [considering] the seminary of Paris.\nI asked them, \u201cWhy do you come to see me?\u201d They told me that they had a meeting in the house of the Oblate of Maria with the priest who oversees young men who may have vocations to the priesthood in the Diocese of Paris.\nThere was a total of fifteen young men for all of the Diocese of Paris.\nDuring the meeting, the priest, before he celebrated the Eucharist, said, \u201cToday we celebrate the Eucharist, but we do not believe in the Real Presence.\u201d These two young men said \u201cThat is impossible.\nWe cannot remain in this seminary.\u201d So, they came to meet me.\nThey said that Econe is the only seminary where they seem to be able to find the True Faith.\nThey asked for admittance to Econe.\nAnd I think that they shall be coming to Econe next October.\nBut that is a new religion.\nIt is a Protestant religion.\nThat is a fact.\nPerhaps you can say, \u201cHow is it possible that the pope gives the authorization to this change?\nHow is it possible the pope signed this decree?\nSigned this constitution?\u201d I don\u2019t know.\nI don\u2019t know.\nIt is a big mystery.\nA big mystery.\nThere are many proposed theological answers.\nI cannot subscribe to all of them.\nSome say the pope is not responsible.\nPerhaps someone gave the pope an injection, a drug, and he is not responsible.\nPerhaps, I don\u2019t know.\nSome say there are two popes [(a body double)].\nI don\u2019t know.\nSome say the pope was liberal before he was elected pope, and perhaps (we do not know) he gave his name to Freemasonry (thereby incurring excommunication before the conclave).\nWe do not know.\nWe do know now that Bugnini was primarily responsible for the change in liturgy, and that he is an infamous Freemason.\nAnd because he had an indiscretion with his Masonic appurtenances, the Pope sent him as a Nuncio in Iran.\nI don\u2019t know.\nWe don\u2019t know.\nNow, you cannot say that Archbishop Lefebvre said the pope gave his name to Freemasonry.\nNo, you cannot say that.\nIt is possible, but we do not know.\nBut if he was excommunicated, then he is not pope.\nNot pope.\nIllegitimate.\nI don\u2019t know.\nIt is a mystery I cannot understand.\nBut the fact is that the Catholic Church is being destroyed, and now even the pope himself says that.\nThis pope has referred to the auto-demolition of the Church.\nHe said, \u201cThe smoke of Satan has entered the Church.\u201d But where are the men responsible for the destruction of the Church?\nWell, there they are.\nThey are the men who destroy the Church.\nWe must show where they are.\nWhere is this smoke of Satan that has entered the Church?\nI do not know, but it is the pope himself who said that.\nAnd I have these experiences every day.\nI visit many countries.\nI was in Spain during the Christmas Holy Days.\nThen I was in Bonn, near Cologne, Germany, three weeks ago, to speak at a conference.\nMany people came.\nMany people are confused.\nWhat is happening in the Church?\nThey are anxious.\nBut many people say that we disobey.\nDisobey?\nObedience is relative.\nIt is not absolute.\nIt is relative to the good, but not to the evil.\nWe cannot obey our parents if they command a bad thing.\nWe cannot obey.\nIt is clear.\nAnd I know that in Spain, for example, the situation in the Church is very bad.\nThe new nominees of bishops and many auxiliary bishops are, approximately, communist, Marxist, and socialist.\nAnd so, a majority of the bishops in the Episcopal Conference of Spain are progressives.\nThey are modernists.\nWhereas, the majority of the bishops [from Spain] during the Council were conservative.\nSo, Rome is responsible [for the situation of the Church in Spain] because it is Rome who approves the nominations for bishops.\nAnd we know in France, in Germany, and in Europe generally, that all of the young bishops are worse [than the bishops in Spain] in that they are more or less Marxist.\nThat is a fact.\nThat is impossible.\nHow can they do that?\nI do not know.\nI do not know.\nI have not spent my whole life in Rome.\nI do know Rome very well, because I was an apostolic delegate, and I was in the Secretariate of the Secretary of State.\nAnd I know that very well.\nBut I think that the devil is in Rome, as was said by our Lady of Fatima and Our Lady of La Salette.\nWe must pray.\nWe must ask God to put an end to this crisis of the Church.\nBecause if this crisis continues, many people will go to hell.\nThey lose the faith.\nThey cannot go into the church.\nThey abandon the faith.\nYou know that many priests have abandoned the faith.\nMany priests have gotten married.\nAnd many sisters have abandoned their congregations.\nIt is a pity.\nAnd it is everywhere.\nI was in Melbourne, Australia, during the 40th International Eucharistic Congress.\nCardinal Knox, who was the man responsible for the Eucharistic Congress, is now the Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship.\nI read in the newspaper about a Mass Cardinal Knox celebrated during the Eucharistic Congress where sensual dancing was performed at the same time the words of the Consecration were pronounced.\nThat is a sacrilege.\nYou cannot go to that Mass.\nThat is sacrilege.\nThis is a fact.\nThey also called me by phone in Melbourne to say I was on the list of the bishops [attending] the Eucharistic Congress.\nThey asked me to concelebrate Mass with a Protestant pastor and a rabbi.\nAy.\nImpossible.\nImpossible.\nNo, no, no, no.\n[applause]\nThis change is not accidental.\nIt is not superficial.\nIt is very deep.\nVery bad.\nIt is against our faith.\nAgainst our faith.\nAnd so, we cannot accept this Council and this reform and this orientation even though it comes from Rome.\nFrom Rome we expect only the good.\nWe do not expect the bad, the ill. We do not expect the abandonment of adoration in the Mass.\nWe need this adoration.\nWe need to have the faith in the divinity of Jesus Christ.\nBecause all [of this change] is [oriented] against the divinity of Jesus Christ, against the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, against the Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Mass.\nIt is a sin when we abandon the truth of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, everywhere, and we abandon the Faith of the divinity of Jesus Christ.\nHe is King because he is God.\nHe is the Son of God.\nSo, He is King by His nature.\nThis is essential.\nEssential!\nAnd if He is God, we must give Him the adoration of God.\nAnd so, we cannot accept the diminution of this Truth.\nJesus Christ is the Son of God.\nJesus Christ is God.\nThat is a fundamental truth of our Faith.\nAnd it all depends on this Truth.\nAnd we know now that the theologians and the bishops have [a new orientation].\nThey do not express this truth clearly and perfectly.\nThey are afraid of the truth.\nThat is very bad.\nAnd it is the same in Rome.\nI think they refuse [to grant me an audience with] the pope, [because they are afraid of the Truth].\nWhen I was in Rome one month ago, Mgr.\nBenelli told me he visits the pope every day.\nHe said that when he left me, he would go immediately to the pope to express the importance of the work we had conducted during our meeting.\nImmediately, he said, he would be going.\nSo, why do they not grant me the possibility of visiting the pope?\nBecause they are afraid.\nMeanwhile the Vatican operated a veritable swinging door where actual heretics and schismatics were concerned.\nHere, again, is Blessed Paul VI, famously meeting for the first time ever with the heretic Archbishop of Canterbury in St. Peter's:\nCardinal Villot said, \u201cWe are afraid if Msgr.\nLefebvre meets and speaks with the pope that perhaps the pope will change his mind.\u201d Because [the pope] is not too sure; the pope is not man of true conviction.\nHe is a mysterious man.\nWe cannot give a definition of the man.\nHe expresses the truth, and then he does the contrary/opposite.\nSome part of him will speak the truth.\nAnother part of him is open to error.\nVery curious.\nAnd they are afraid that if I reveal the truth [and tell the Pope] \u201cyou must affirm the Kingdom of Jesus Christ everywhere and always each day.\nYou must affirm the Real Presence in the Mass - in the Sacrifice of the Mass,\u201d then perhaps it is possible that the Pope will change his mind.\nAnd so, Cardinal Villot says, there is a confusion, and they do not want me to visit the pope.\nIt is impossible to admit me.\nAnd I know the pope very well!\nWhen I was the apostolic delegate to Pius XII, I was going to Rome every year.\nAnd during those eleven years, I met Msgr.\nMontini.\nI know him very well.\nHe received me twice during the Council, for a private audience with the pope.\nBut, now, with my position against the Council and the reforms, he says: \u201cNo, impossible!\nYou must sign in writing that you [accept] the Council and all the reforms before I will receive you in audience.\u201d But I cannot do that.\nFor me, if I do that, then I betray my mother, the Church.\nThe Church!\nSo, I thank you very much for your encouragement, and I must say that we have a very good generation of young men and good vocations.\nFor the coming year we have 59 applications to our seminary in Econe, Switzerland \u2013 applications from the United States, from England, from Germany, from France, and Spain.\nGood young men with good dispositions are coming from everywhere.\nAnd why?\nWhy do they come to this seminary when they know we are in difficulties with Rome?\nThey know that.\nBut still they come.\nI ask them, why do you come to Econe?\nYou know our situation.\nThey say, \u201cYes, we know your situation, but we want to become true priests and not protestant pastors or modernist priests.\nWe are coming to your seminary because we know that the end of the priest is to offer the true Sacrifice of the Mass.\nAnd so, we are Coming to Econe.\u201d\nAnd as I have visited my seminary here in Armada for the past five days, I can see it is the same here.\nWe have very good young men.\nI also have some Americans in my seminary in Econe.\nIn six weeks I will ordain one American priest from Detroit, who is a very good seminarian and will be a good priest.\nBut these young men refuse to become protestants.\nThey refuse to become modernist.\nThey ask to become true priests.\nAnd it is a pity there are not 100 bishops opening good seminaries.\nSo, I ask you to pray for these seminarians because when they become priests they will have many worries and many difficulties.\nI think, however, they are very well prepared to deal with these difficulties and worries.\nAnd we have confidence in God.\nSince I began this work six years ago, now, I have evidence that God is assisting us.\nBecause it is impossible, I realize, to do this by myself.\nWe now have houses in Switzerland (3), Munich, France (6), Brussels (1), England, Armada, San Francisco, and New York.\nIn Albano, near Rome, we have a congregation of sisters where I have five vocations from the states (good sisters).\nAnd I am building a seminary in Switzerland.\nIt is impossible to do all this without God\u2019s assistance.\nSo, I have confidence.\nIt is impossible for the Church to change its tradition.\nThe tradition of twenty centuries.\nThat we cannot change.\nThe Church is tradition.\nThe Church is tradition.\nIt is not revolution.\nI thank you for your attention.\nNOTES:\n[1] Archbishop Benelli, who had the title of \u201cSubstitute\u201d (meaning the Assistant to the Secretary of State) of the Vatican Secretariat of State, later created Cardinal

student politician was not anti-Semitic: McGill report\nMONTREAL \u2013 It was political disagreement \u2014 not anti-Semitism \u2014 that led to a Jewish student being voted off the McGill University student council\u2019s board of directors, an investigation ordered by the principal has concluded.\nBut Jewish groups on and off campus have denounced the report as flawed, saying it missed the significance of an anti-Semitic text circulated online before Noah Lew was removed from the board last fall.\nA joint statement from five campus Jewish groups says the report, released this week by principal Suzanne Fortier, \u201cappears to condone discrimination against Jewish students at McGill based on the cultural and religious organizations they affiliate with.\u201d\nThe controversy has its roots in McGill\u2019s long-running debate over the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.\nAt an Oct. 23 general assembly of the Student Society of McGill University, a routine motion to elect a slate of directors turned contentious.\nSupporters of a group called Democratize SSMU, formed to fight a decision of the board of directors declaring BDS counter to the SSMU constitution, brought a motion to divide the election vote.\nIn the past they had been ratified as a bloc.\nThe first five candidates were overwhelmingly approved, but when they got to Lew, the only Jewish director, he was rejected 105 to 73.\nIn a subsequent Facebook post, Lew wrote, \u201cMy Jewish identity was now public, and a target was placed squarely upon me by the McGill BDS movement.\u201d\nAn outcry followed, leading Fortier to appoint former Ombudsperson for Students, Spencer Boudreau, to investigate.\nShe also created a Task Force on Respect and Inclusion in Campus Life and a support line to report incidents of intolerance.\nBoudreau interviewed 38 students over his three-and-a-half week investigation.\nHis findings, he wrote, do \u201cnot substantiate the notion that the vote was motivated by anti-Semitism,\u201d which he defined as hostility toward or discrimination against Jews.\nRather, he found, votes against Lew were \u201cmotivated by politics, that is, based on his support for Israel and Zionism and/or for his view of the BDS movement.\u201d Protests about Israel\u2019s policies cannot be equated with anti-Semitism, Boudreau wrote, though he said Lew\u2019s belief that he was targeted because he was Jewish was \u201chonest and even understandable.\u201d\nA statement Wednesday by Hillel McGill, Chabad at McGill and three other Jewish groups said Boudreau was mistaken about the timing of an anti-Semitic message posted online by Democratize SSMU.\nBoudreau\u2019s report said the message followed the assembly vote, but in fact it was posted at the beginning of October.\nDemocratize SSMU deleted the message, which targeted Lew and two other candidates, after the meeting and apologized for publishing material that was \u201cinsensitive to anti-Semitic tropes of Jewish people as corrupt and politically powerful.\u201d\nThe Jewish groups said this anti-Semitic rhetoric \u201cwas used to encourage students to vote specifically against Noah Lew.\nIt is under this context that the (general assembly) occurred, and the report fundamentally misunderstands this, which alters the entire findings of the report.\u201d\nThey say Boudreau\u2019s report \u201cinsinuates that Jewish students who engage with mainstream Jewish community organizations are permitted to be precluded from holding political

overseas trip\nNORFOLK, Va. \u2014 While texting with an FBI informant in September 2016, a Williamsburg man expressed admiration for a U.S. Army officer who shot and killed 13 soldiers on Fort Hood, Texas, according to court documents.\nLater that year, Shivam Patel, 28, tried to join the U.S. Army and Air Force.\nAnd in the application process, he lied to military recruiters about a recent trip he'd taken to Jordan in a failed attempt to make contact with the Islamic State and join a \"real Muslim Army,\" the documents said.\nPatel pleaded guilty Thursday in U.S. District Court to two counts of making false statements.\nHe faces up to 15 years in prison when sentenced June 4.\nAccording to court documents and prosecutors, Patel \u2013 who was raised Hindu before converting to Islam several years ago \u2013 traveled to China in July 2016 to teach English.\nWhile there, however, he grew displeased with how that country treated Muslims.\nHis employer arranged for Patel to fly back to Virginia on Aug. 23, 2016, but instead Patel chose to travel to Jordan, a statement of facts filed with his plea agreement said.\nJordanian officials arrested Patel a few days later.\nIt's unclear why, but court documents say Patel told taxi drivers and others in Jordan that he supported the Islamic State.\nA search of Patel's computer also showed he researched how to join the Islamic State before he left for China.\nJordanian officials moved for Patel's deportation.\nOn Sept. 2, 2016, he boarded a flight to Chicago, and the next day, he flew to Detroit.\nThere, he met an FBI source and started talking about the Islamic State.\nHe explained he went to Jordan in part to find like-minded Muslims, and because he wanted to do something \u201cbigger, better, and more purposeful\u201d \u2013 like dying in the cause of Allah.\nBut, he said, he was afraid of making his parents sad.\nIn the course of their conversations, Patel discussed his desire to see a holy war between Muslims and non-Muslims.\nHe also sang an Islamic State fight song and recalled making a replica of the group\u2019s flag.\nHe said he wanted to replace his neighbor\u2019s American flag with it.\nPatel returned to Williamsburg on Sept. 6, 2016.\nShortly thereafter, he moved into a motel his parents owned and started applying for jobs with the military, as well as some paramilitary organizations \u2013 like police and fire departments, correctional facilities and probation offices.\nWhile back in Virginia, Patel stayed in touch with the FBI source.\nHe texted the source on Sept. 23, 2016, and expressed support for Maj. Nidal Hasan, who killed 13 soldiers in 2009 while serving at Fort Hood.\nIn the process, however, he misidentified Hasan as Nidal Hussein and said the shooting happened at Fort Knox in Kentucky.\nHe also said Hasan had died a martyr, though in fact he remains alive on military death row.\nCourt documents show Patel began saying in late 2016 that he did not actually support the Islamic State.\nSimply expressing support for a terrorist organization or attack is not against the law.\nPatel's crime was failing to disclose his trips to Jordan when he was trying to join the Army and Air Force in December 2016 and January 2017.\nCourt documents say Patel lied about his travel history, saying his only time out of the country in the past seven years was a family trip to India in 2011 and 2012.\nBefore Patel signed the Army application, a recruiter asked him specifically about the travel question and reminded him providing false information could result in criminal charges.\nDuring the interview, the recruiter asked to see Patel's passport to confirm his travel claims.\nPatel agreed to bring it by, but two days later he told the State Department he had accidentally thrown it away in October and needed a new one.\nAfter Patel's arrest in July, investigators found his passport \"near\" the motel room where he was living, the documents said.\n\u00a92018 The Virginian-Pilot (Norfolk, Va.)\nVisit The Virginian-Pilot at pilotonline.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n", ["Doubt", "Appeal_to_fear-prejudice", "Exaggeration,Minimisation", "Name_Calling,Labeling", "Flag-Waving"]], ["Uranium One Informant Breaks Silence: Moscow Paid Millions To Influence Hillary Clinton\nThe President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\n-Article 2, Section 4 of the US Constitution\nRight off the bat, this appears to be clear bribery, and a case could be made for treason.\nHowever, it is now being reported that an FBI informant that was involved in the Uranium One deal, has told congressional committees that Moscow paid lobbyists to influence then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by helping former President Bill Clinton\u2019s charities during the Obama administration.\nThe Hill's John Solomon reported on Wednesday:\nThe informant, Douglas Campbell, said in the statement obtained by The Hill that he was told by Russian nuclear executives that Moscow had hired the American lobbying firm APCO Worldwide specifically because it was in position to influence the Obama administration, and more specifically Hillary Clinton.\n... Campbell added in the testimony that Russian nuclear officials \u201ctold me at various times that they expected APCO to apply a portion of the $3 million annual lobbying fee it was receiving from the Russians to provide in-kind support for the Clintons' Global Initiative.\"\n\u201cThe contract called for four payments of $750,000 over twelve months.\nAPCO was expected to give assistance free of charge to the Clinton Global Initiative as part of their effort to create a favorable environment to ensure the Obama administration made affirmative decisions on everything from Uranium One to the U.S.-Russia Civilian Nuclear Cooperation agreement.\"\nAPCO officials told The Hill that its support for the Clinton Global Initiative and its work with Russia were not connected in any way, and in fact involved different divisions of the firm.\nThey added their lobbying for Russia did not involve Uranium One but rather focused on regulatory issues aimed at helping Russia better compete for nuclear fuel contracts inside the United States.\nIn case you are unfamiliar with Uranium One, it is a Canadian mining company whose sale to a Russian firm was approved in 2010.\nThe sale gave the Russians control of part of the US uranium supply, thus why I reference a case could be made for treason.\nWhile Democrats have unsurprisingly questioned Campbell's credibility, Campbell's attorney Victoria Toensing told Sean Hannity, \u201c[The Russians] were so confident that they told Mr. Campbell with the Clinton\u2019s help, it was a shoo-in to get CFIUS [The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] approval.\nThey were so confident in that that they even had him open up the new office because they were planning on the kind of business they were going to do as soon as CFIUS approved it.\u201d\nIn a lengthy report by Award-winning National Security/War Correspondent Sara Carter, she pointed out that following:\nOn Wednesday, he shared with the committee information he provided to the FBI and has in the past described his frustration with the Obama administration\u2019s failure to stop Russia\u2019s nuclear giant from purchasing 20 percent of American uranium mining assets.\nCampbell testified before numerous Congressional investigators that his extensive counterintelligence work on Russia and stated that during his time as an informant, he obtained information that Russia was continuing to aid the Iranian government.\nAccording to Campbell Russia provided the resources necessary for the nation\u2019s nuclear reactors, despite promises that they were not sharing such technology with Iran.\nIn an April 16, 2010, summary brief provided to his former FBI handlers and obtained by this reporter, he stressed his deep concerns about Tenex, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Russian state nuclear arm Rosatom and its ongoing work to provide Iran with the technology needed for its nuclear reactor program.\nAt the time, Rosatom was seeking the approval to purchase the Canadian mining company Uranium One.\n\u201cTENEX continues to supply Iran with fuel through their Russian company TVEL,\u201d stated Campbell in a 2010 brief provided to the FBI.\nTVEL is a Russian nuclear fuel cycle company headquartered in Moscow.\n\u201cThey (TVEL) continue to assist with construction consult and fabricated assemblies to supply the reactor.\nFabricated assemblies require sophisticated engineering and are arranged inside the reactor with the help and consult of TVEL.\u201d Campbell informed the FBI of the close relationship between TVEL and TENEX, both a part of the Rosatom group.\nHe stated in his brief that while spending time with the Russian executives from both Rosatom and Tenex, that any mention of \u201cTVEL is a subject that is serious to all when mentioned.\nI do not even raise the subject of TVEL to our friends, but occasionally they speak of it and always in a guarded manner.\u201d In the briefs, he informed the FBI that \u201coccasionally someone will mention having been in Iran but usually it is long after the fact.\u201d And when he asked the Russians about these connections, he stated that they \u201coccasionally speak of the relationship, i.e.\nequipment, consulting.\nI asked Vadim (Mikerin) if they felt there was a serious problem, and would they adhere to sanctions and western opinion.\nHis response was a smile and shoulder shrug.\u201d But Campbell had provided the FBI with evidence of the criminal network and delivered the information to the FBI, which was monitoring his work as an informant and approving his transfer of bribery money to the Russians.\nThose transfers, which were made in bulk $50,000 sums and at times delivered in cash, occurred between senior executives of the American transportation company and the Russian executives connected to Rosatom.\nHe had given the FBI irrefutable evidence showing how contracts obtained from the same Russian energy company Tenex, were based on contract bribery and other nefarious actions, he said.\nSenior members of the FBI, Department of Treasury, Department of Energy and Department of Justice were also briefed on Campbell\u2019s information and were apprised of the various facets pertaining to Russia\u2019s acquisition of the Canadian company.\nIn fact, Campbell had been told by his FBI handlers that his work had made it at least twice into President Obama\u2019s classified presidential daily briefings.\nOf course, we know what Obama did with his daily briefings.\nThey are somewhere in the White House sewer system.\nCampbell's work has resulted in real justice being administered.\nIn January, I reported:\nOn Friday, the Justice Department unsealed an 11-count indictment concerning the Uranium One scandal.\nSadly, it did not include former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, but rather former DoD intelligence analyst-turned uranium transportation executive Mark Lambert of Mount Airy, Maryland.\nLambert, 54, was charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering.\nThe charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of Russia\u2019s State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX.\nAccording to the DOJ: According to the indictment, beginning at least as early as 2009 and continuing until October 2014, Lambert conspired with others at \u201cTransportation Corporation A\u201d to make corrupt and fraudulent bribery and kickback payments to offshore bank accounts associated with shell companies, at the direction of, and for the benefit of, a Russian official, Vadim Mikerin, in order to secure improper business advantages and obtain and retain business with TENEX.\nIn order to effectuate and conceal the corrupt and fraudulent bribe payments, Lambert and others allegedly caused fake invoices to be prepared, purportedly from TENEX to Transportation Corporation A, that described services that were never provided, and then Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to wire the corrupt payments for those purported services to shell companies in Latvia, Cyprus and Switzerland.\nLambert and others also allegedly used code words like \u201clucky figures,\u201d \u201cLF,\u201d \u201clucky numbers,\u201d and \u201ccake\u201d to describe the payments in emails to the Russian official at his personal email account.\nThe indictment also alleges that Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to overbill TENEX by building the cost of the corrupt payments into their invoices, and TENEX thus overpaid for Transportation Corporation A\u2019s services.\nIn June 2015, Lambert\u2019s former co-president, Daren Condrey, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the FCPA and commit wire fraud, and Vadim Mikerin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering involving violations of the FCPA.\nMikerin is currently serving a sentence of 48 months in prison and Condrey is awaiting sentencing.\nThe indictment includes allegations against Lambert based on his role in effectuating the criminal scheme with Condrey, Mikerin, and others.\nWe also know the following about Campbell:\nUndercover FBI informant William Campbell has given written testimony to Congressional investigators after an \"iron clad\" gag order was lifted in October\nCampbell was a highly valued CIA and FBI asset deeply embedded in the Russian nuclear industry while Robert Mueller was the Director of the FBI\nwhile Robert Mueller was the Director of the FBI Campbell was required by the Russians, under threat, to launder large sums of money - which allowed the FBI to uncover a massive Russian \"nuclear money laundering apparatus \"\n\" He collected over 5,000 documents and briefs over a six year period, some of which detail efforts by Moscow to route money to the Clinton Foundation\nCampbell claims to have video evidence of bribe money related to the Uranium One deal being stuffed into suitcases.\nof bribe money related to the Uranium One deal being stuffed into suitcases.\nThe Obama FBI knew about the bribery scheme, yet the administration still approved the Uranium One deal.\nTo thank him for his service, Campbell was paid $51,000 by FBI officials at a 2016 celebration dinner in Chrystal City\nWhen it emerged that Campbell had evidence against the Clinton Foundation, a Yahoo News article by Michael Isikoff (of FISA warrant application fame) slammed Campbell as a \"disaster\" potential witness\nAll of this then goes back to things we have pointed out with ranchers in the western united States and how this impacts them, as well as the land grabs that are unconstitutionally orchestrated by the DC government and the Bureau of Land Management.\nThere is also substantial documentation that was discovered in Oregon that relates to this deal during the Oregon occupation in 2016, which got zero coverage in the mainstream media.\nAre we about to see a serious shakedown in all of this?\nTime will tell, but I remain skeptical, as in the end, all we ever get is excuses rather than justice.\n", ["Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling,Labeling", "Doubt"]], ["German cardinal: liturgical \u2018blessing\u2019 for gay unions is \u2018truly\u2026sacrilegious\u2019\nNewsCatholic Church\nGERMANY, February 8, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) \u2013 Cardinal Paul Josef Cordes criticized fellow German Cardinal Reinhard Marx\u2019s suggestion that Catholic priests should consider \u201cblessing\u201d same-sex relationships liturgically.\nMarx\u2019s idea \u201ctruly seems sacrilegious\u201d and \u201cignores the clear Revelation of God,\u201d Cordes wrote in a response on kath.net.\nDr. Maike Hickson translated it at One Peter Five.\n\u201cThe Church is in its pastoral care bound to Holy Scripture and to its interpretation through the Church\u2019s Magisterium,\u201d wrote Cordes.\n\u201cMarx does not even mention that homosexuality always contradicts the Will of God,\u201d citing church teaching through the centuries.\nRather than being about receiving \u201cGod\u2019s assistance for themselves,\u201d those engaging in sodomy and wishing to have it \u201cblessed\u201d by the Church \u201caim with their request at the recognition and acceptance of their homosexual way of life and its ecclesial valorization.\u201d\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that \u201cunder no circumstances\u201d can homosexual activity \u201cbe approved\u201d as it is \u201cintrinsically disordered.\u201d Such acts are \u201ccontrary to the natural law.\nThey close the sexual act to the gift of life.\nThey do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity\u201d (CCC 2357).\nHowever, Marx said on February 3 that homosexual couples need \u201ccloser pastoral care\u201d and \u201cone must also encourage priests and pastoral workers to give people in concrete situations [of homosexual unions] encouragement.\nI do not really see any problems there.\u201d\nMarx is the President of the German Bishops\u2019 Conference.\nAs LifeSiteNews previously reported, Marx also said \u201cyes,\u201d he could imagine the creation of a rite for homosexual couples to be blessed in the Church.\nThis \u201cencouragement\u201d from priests which he called for might include some sort of \u201cliturgical\u201d recognition of their union.\nBut \u201chow this would be done publicly, in a liturgical form,\u201d is \u201canother question...that is where one has to be reticent and also reflect upon that in a good way.\u201d\nAfter Catholic News Agency\u2019s initial report on Marx\u2019s comments, his office contacted the outlet and said they had mistranslated part of what he said.\nThe cardinal\u2019s office sent CNA \u201ca request for correction of [its] translation of the interview in question, expressing concern that CNA's translation constitutes a false reference and does not properly reflect the position of Cardinal Marx.\u201d\nThe cardinal\u2019s office maintains that rather than saying \u201cyes,\u201d there is a possibility of liturgical \u201cblessing\u201d of gay unions, he answered the question in a more subtle way without giving an explicit \u201cyes.\u201d However, the German Bishops\u2019 Conference doesn\u2019t seem to deny the rest of his statements on how \u201cone must encourage priests\u201d to give encouragement to homosexual couples, which could include public blessings that would take a \u201cliturgical\u201d form.\nThe cardinal\u2019s staff asked that CNA change his answer about liturgically \u201cblessing\u201d gay unions to: \u201cThere are no general solutions and I think that would not be right, because we are talking about pastoral care for individual cases, and that applies to other areas as well, which we cannot regulate, where we have no sets of rules.\u201d\nPhiladelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput has also spoken out against Marx\u2019s proposal.\n\u201cAny such \u2018blessing rite\u2019 would cooperate in a morally forbidden act, no matter how sincere the persons seeking the blessing,\u201d wrote Chaput.\nHe explained such a \u201cblessing\u201d would encourage people to continue living in a way the Church considers gravely sinful and spiritually damaging, and therefore would be uncharitable.\n\u201cThere is no love \u2013 no charity \u2013 without truth, just as there is no real mercy separated from a framework of justice informed and guided by truth,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cCreating confusion around important truths of our faith, no matter how positive the intention, only makes a difficult task more difficult.\u201d\n\u201cThere are two principles we need to remember,\u201d Chaput wrote.\n\u201cFirst, we need to treat all people with the respect and pastoral concern they deserve as children of God with inherent dignity.\nThis emphatically includes persons with same-sex attraction.\nSecond, there is no truth, no real mercy, and no authentic compassion, in blessing a course of action that leads persons away from God.\u201d\n\u201cThis in no way is a rejection of the persons seeking such a blessing, but rather a refusal to ignore what we know to be true about the nature of marriage, the family, and the dignity of human sexuality,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cJesus said the truth will make us free.\nNowhere did he suggest it will make us comfortable.\u201d\nCordes has a history of defending the Church\u2019s moral teaching.\nMarx, one of the pope\u2019s nine main advisors, said in 2016 that same-sex relationships have \u201cworth\u201d which must be recognized by the

minutes ago when Pope Francis shouted at a reporter in Chile that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d supporting complaints against his good friend Bishop Juan Barros?\nAnd, just for good measure he accused the people accusing him \u2013 victims of sexual abuse by Barros\u2019 mentor, the convicted sex-predator Karadima \u2013 of committing \u201ccalumny\u201d?\n[1] And remember when Cardinal O\u2019Malley told the pope off in public over the \u201cpain\u201d these accusations had caused the victims of sexual abuse?\nAnd then remember how the pope had apologised-except-not-really because the accusations are, after all, still lies, and that there\u2019s still \u201cno evidence\u201d against Barros\u2026?\nThe press, secular as well as Catholic, is full this week of the story that the pope did indeed see evidence of Barros\u2019 complicity in Karadima\u2019s sexual abuse \u2013 not only that Barros had helped to cover it up but that he had been present and a direct witness at the time and therefore a passive participant.\nNicole Winfield and the Associated Press dropped the bomb that the information came directly from the victims, whom Francis had dismissed and refused to meet with on his trip, and delivered through his own Commission on sexual abuse:\nPope Francis received a victim\u2019s letter in 2015 that graphically detailed how a priest sexually abused him and how other Chilean clergy ignored it, contradicting the pope\u2019s recent insistence that no victims had come forward to denounce the cover-up, the letter\u2019s author and members of Francis\u2019 own sex- abuse commission have told The Associated Press.\nThe fact that Francis received the eight-page letter, obtained by the AP, challenges his insistence that he has \u201czero tolerance\u201d for sex abuse and cover-ups.\nIt also calls into question his stated empathy with abuse survivors, compounding the most serious crisis of his five-year papacy.\nNow it appears that Francis had also overruled a 2015 warning from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that Barros should not be made a bishop.\nThe Italian Catholic daily La Nuova Bussola Quotidiana reports that not only did the pope see a letter from victims, but that the CDF, under Muller, \u201chad already conducted an preliminary investigation into Barros and the other bishops close to Karadima which had led to the decision to relieve them of their duties.\u201d\n\u201cBut with a letter signed by the Pope in January 2015 and sent to the Chilean bishops, the request for exemption is blocked and shortly thereafter Barros is promoted to\u2026Osorno.\u201d\nThe article points out that while Karadima was convicted by a Vatican tribunal on the testimony of the victims, it is the same testimony of the same victim-witnesses that Francis now dismisses in the accusations against Barros.\nThe accusations that stood against Karadima come from the same sources as those against Barros, who the victims said was in the room watching at the time.\nWhile the specifics are still not known, readers may be reminded by this of a peculiar incident about a year later in which Pope Francis summarily ordered the dismissal of three priests of the CDF, whose remit was investigations of clerics accused of sexual abuse.\nThe website One Peter Five reports, via Marco Tosatti, that the pope ordered their removal without offering any explanation to then-cardinal prefect Gerhard Muller.\nWhen, after several attempts and three months later[2], Muller was able to get an audience with the pope to ask the reason, he received the response, \u201cI am the pope, I do not need to give reasons for any of my decisions.\nI have decided that they have to leave and they have to leave.\u201d\nMarco Tosatti reports the CDF incident, but it follows an odd story of a meeting of curial officials to discuss certain bishop appointments.\nWithout naming names, (or, frustratingly, giving dates[3]) Tosatti relates:\n\u201cIt was some time ago to make a bishop, not in Italy.\nThe nuncio has prepared the triad [the \u201cterna\u201d or list of three candidates].\nA cardinal, head of the dicastery, perhaps the same holder of the Congregation for Bishops, during the ordinary assembly took the floor, saying: \u2018The first candidate indicated is excellent, the second is good.\nBut I would like to warn of the third, whom I know well, since he was a seminarian, and who presents problems both on the level of doctrine and morality.\nHe responds little to the necessary criteria.\nBut the third was a friend of someone and another cardinal, of the circle currently in power, has flung himself at his colleague, accusing him of impropriety.\u2019 The meeting ended without further decisions.\u201d\nWhatever the details of these strange incidents, what is clear in Chile is that no amount of eyewitness testimony was going to make the slightest difference.\nBergoglio wanted Barros as a bishop and that was that.\nEven while \u201capologising\u201d the pope had doubled down when questioned about it by journalists, saying, \u201cYou, in all good will, tell me that there are victims, but I haven\u2019t seen any, because they haven\u2019t come forward.\u201d\n\u201cIn the case of Barros it\u2019s been observed, it\u2019s been studied; there\u2019s no evidence.\nThe best thing to do if someone believes it\u2019s the case is to come forward quickly with evidence.\u201d\nThe AP report, however, says exactly the opposite; that members of his own (now defunct[4]) abuse Commission had approached Cardinal O\u2019Malley, the pope\u2019s \u201ctop abuse advisor,\u201d with the letter to deliver to the pope.\nMarie Collins, the Irish abuse survivor and Commission member who resigned, citing the Vatican\u2019s refusal to take meaningful action, told AP, \u201cWhen we gave him [O\u2019Malley] the letter for the pope, he assured us he would give it to the pope and speak of the concerns.\nAnd at a later date, he assured us that that had been done.\u201d Juan Carlos Cruz, the Karadima victim whose membership on the Commission the Vatican had blocked, told AP, \u201cCardinal O\u2019Malley called me after the pope\u2019s visit here in Philadelphia and he told me, among other things, that he had given the letter to the pope \u2013 in his hands.\u201d\nOn the face of it, there are only a few logical possibilities here.\nIn fact, unless Cardinal O\u2019Malley \u2013 who has, as of this writing, remained silent \u2013 comes forward and says that he didn\u2019t hand the letter over pope, there is really only one; that the pope lied.\nAnd this is what is now being said quite openly by a vast array of voices, secular and Catholic, left and right.\nAs Winfield writes,\n\u201cThe revelation could be costly for Francis, whose track record on the abuse crisis was already shaky after a botched Italian abuse case he intervened in became public[5].\nMore recently, he let the abuse commission lapse at the end of last year.\nVatican analysts now openly question whether he \u2018gets it,\u2019 and some of his own advisers privately acknowledge that maybe he doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cNo evidence\u2026\u201d Lie big, lie often, and when caught, keep lying.\nOne of the many things these secular reporters seem not to be paying attention to is that \u201cno evidence\u201d is in fact a well-rehearsed, stock response for Bergoglio.\nHe said almost exactly the same in 2013 when confronted about another predatory homosexual he was sheltering.\nThe hoopla surrounding the \u201cWho am I to judge\u201d comment tends to obscure the context of the comment.\nIt was made in response to a question by a journalist about Monsignore Battista Ricca \u2013 a prelate whose promiscuous homosexuality is so well known it was covered by the Telegraph as early as July 2013.\nIlze Scamparini asked the pope about Ricca, saying, \u201cWhat you intend to do about this?\nHow are you confronting this issue and how does Your Holiness intend to confront the whole question of the gay lobby?\u201d\nWhat reply did Bergoglio give?\nHis standard one: \u201cNo evidence.\u201d\nAbout Monsignor Ricca: I did what canon law calls for, that is a preliminary investigation.\nAnd from this investigation, there was nothing of what had been alleged.\nWe did not find anything of that.\nThis is the response.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cIn this case, I conducted the preliminary investigation and we didn\u2019t find anything.\u201d\nBut Ricca\u2019s activities, for which the pope claimed there was no evidence, were notorious.\nThey include being caught in flagrante in an elevator with a teenaged male prostitute, and his sexual relationship with a captain in the Swiss army.\nSo flagrant was Ricca\u2019s behaviour that it took intervention by Uruguay\u2019s nuncio to have him removed.\nIt was reported in 1999 and 2000 by L\u2019Espresso, who said the information was confirmed by \u201cnumerous bishops, priests, religious and laity\u201d in Uruguay[6].\nIn fact, the evidence shows that Ricca is completely in line with Bergoglio\u2019s normal procedures.\nAs \u201cMarcantonio Colonna\u201d wrote in the Dictator Pope, \u201cIn fact his patronage of Monsignor Ricca fits the pattern which was well established when he was Archbishop of Buenos Aires, whereby he surrounds himself with morally weak people so as to have them under his thumb.\u201d\nIt was at this early \u201cno evidence\u201d comment on the plane home from Rio that some of those paying attention started to understand that Bergoglio\u2019s policy is in line with that of certain leaders of the past who recommended that if a politician was going to lie, he should lie big and lie brazenly.\nAnd in case anyone was wondering what will happen next, the same advice said to keep on lying after you\u2019re caught.\nThe pattern of silence and, when pressed, flat-out denial has been Bergoglio\u2019s policy since long before he came on the international scene.\nHe has a long record in Argentina of shaving close to scandals and vociferously denying involvement, and relying heavily on the broad good will of Catholics towards bishops to pull it off.\nPerhaps his biggest error with Barros was failing to understand just how little of that capital of trust there is left in the Catholic world as a whole.\nIndeed, on the subject of priests sexually abusing young people, it could only be measured in the negative numbers.\n\u201cArgentine Victims Who Tried to Meet with Pope Francis\u2026\u201d\nThough the website Bishop Accountability is blatantly anti-clerical, their data is unassailable since most of it comes from information that is already public.\nOn their Argentina page is a long list of accusations that Bergoglio/Francis simply isn\u2019t interested in hearing from victims.\n\u201cIn Pope Francis\u2019s 21 years as bishop and archbishop of Buenos Aires, the Wall Street Journal reports, including the years when he headed the Argentine bishops\u2019 conference, he declined to meet with victims of sexual abuse.\u201d\n\u201cAll of them tried to contact the cardinal archbishop in 2002 or later,\u201d the same period when Pope Benedict and other bishops were striving to meet with victims and demonstrate an interest in the problem.\nThe site says that \u201cin addition to Bergoglio\u2019s failure to respond to victims, the public record contains no evidence that he released any information about abusers.\u201d\nIn fact, he went so far as to flatly deny there had been any instances of abuse in his archdiocese.\nWeeks after his election to the papacy, he was quoted by his close friend, Rabbi Abraham Skorka, \u201cIn my diocese it never happened to me, but a bishop called me once by phone to ask me what to do in a situation like this.\u201d Francis added that he agreed with the \u201czero tolerance\u201d attitude of the Irish episcopate and admired Pope Benedict\u2019s reforms \u2013 most of which he was later to quietly reverse.\nIt was at exactly this time, however, that victims from Argentina were attempting to get the new pope\u2019s attention.\nOne, known to the press only as \u201cGabriel,\u201d wanted to talk to Francis about the sexual abuse he suffered at the hands of Julio C\u00e9sar Grassi, accused of molesting at least five boys, \u201cwho has been avoiding the sentences of the justice of Mor\u00f3n and the Court of Cassation.\nSo far, judges and prosecutors at all instances found him guilty.\u201d\nIn case anyone thinks the Grassi-Gabriel case was not serious enough for the pope\u2019s attention, Bishop Accountability summarises, \u201cA year after Gabriel had filed criminal charges [2003] but before the start of Grassi\u2019s trial, three men ransacked the survivor\u2019s apartment and beat him.\u201d These men threatened to kill him if he did not retract his testimony and quit the case.\nTen years [after Gabriel filed criminal charges], in May 2013, with Grassi still free despite his conviction in 2009, \u201cGabriel and his attorney, Juan Pablo Gallego, brought a two-page letter addressed to Pope Francis to the office of the papal nuncio in Buenos Aires.\nAn employee refused to accept the letter after learning of its topic and threatened to call security if Gabriel and Gallego did not leave the premises.\u201d\nThe group surmises that it was Bergoglio\u2019s direct intervention with judges in the case that prevented a conviction against Grassi for so long and delayed his sentencing through multiple appeals.\nIn 2006, then-Archbishop Bergoglio complained of a \u201cmedia campaign\u201d and claimed that the Grassi case was \u201cdifferent\u201d from other accusations.\nDuring his criminal trial Grassi said Bergoglio \u201cnever let go\u201d of his hand.\nIn 2009, Grassi was convicted of two counts of aggravated sexual assault and corruption in the case of \u201cGabriel,\u201d who was aged 13 at the time of the abuse, but the appeals dragged on until he was finally sent to prison in September 2013.\nSeveral more similar cases, all of whom were rebuffed in their attempts to meet with Bergoglio, are detailed here, for the strong-of-stomach.\nA virtuoso performance-liar\nLooking back and carefully examining his record, Jorge Bergoglio\u2019s mastery of using the weaknesses of morally compromised men is becoming evident.\nIt is arguable that even the members of the so-called \u201cSan Gallen Mafia\u201d who apparently conspired to put him on Peter\u2019s throne were used by him.\nBut he is also a master of judging an audience and telling them what they expect to hear; a key skill for all grifters and confidence tricksters.\nLooking carefully at the infamous \u201cWho am I to judge\u201d comment, this was clear early on.\nThe first part of that interview is a blatant and enormous lie, and it was from there that the pope moved on to his apology for homosexuality in general.\nRecall that this was the very first airplane interview, on the trip back to Rome from World Youth Day in Rio, a matter of weeks after his election.\nAt the time, the papal apologists sprang instantly into action and we heard all about how the pope was talking strictly within the boundaries of Catholic doctrine.\nBut perhaps in hindsight, we are ready to examine the full implications of his little speech, one that was clearly well-rehearsed.\n(Don\u2019t forget, no question is asked in a papal interview without being thoroughly vetted ahead of time.\nJournalists must submit their questions well in advance.)\nThis was the pope laying out his policy regarding homosexuality, a policy for which he was duly rewarded by being lauded on the cover of the homosexualist lobby\u2019s US trade magazine.\nRead his full answer carefully:\nI see that many times in the Church, over and above this case, but including this case, people search for \u201csins from youth\u201d, for example, and then publish them.\nThey are not crimes, right?\nCrimes are something different: the abuse of minors is a crime.\nNo, sins.\nBut if a person, whether it be a lay person, a priest or a religious sister, commits a sin and then converts, the Lord forgives, and when the Lord forgives, the Lord forgets and this is very important for our lives.\nWhen we confess our sins and we truly say, \u201cI have sinned in this\u201d, the Lord forgets, and so we have no right not to forget, because otherwise we would run the risk of the Lord not forgetting our sins.\nThat is a danger.\nThis is important: a theology of sin.\nMany times I think of Saint Peter.\nHe committed one of the worst sins, that is he denied Christ, and even with this sin they made him Pope.\nWe have to think a great deal about that.\nBut, returning to your question more concretely.\nIn this case, I conducted the preliminary investigation and we didn\u2019t find anything.\nThis is the first question.\nThen, you spoke about the gay lobby.\nSo much is written about the gay lobby.\nI still haven\u2019t found anyone with an identity card in the Vatican with \u201cgay\u201d on it.\nThey say there are some there.\nI believe that when you are dealing with such a person, you must distinguish between the fact of a person being gay and the fact of someone forming a lobby, because not all lobbies are good.\nThis one is not good.\nIf someone is gay and is searching for the Lord and has good will, then who am I to judge him?\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church explains this in a beautiful way, saying ... wait a moment, how does it say it ... it says: \u201cno one should marginalize these people for this, they must be integrated into society\u201d.\nThe problem is not having this tendency, no, we must be brothers and sisters to one another, and there is this one and there is that one.\nThe problem is in making a lobby of this tendency: a lobby of misers, a lobby of politicians, a lobby of masons, so many lobbies.\nFor me, this is the greater problem.\nThank you so much for asking this question.\nMany thanks.\nOne of the pope\u2019s favourite rhetorical techniques is a combination of Begging the Question and conspiracy.\nHe starts by assuming, without any effort at defence or explanation, a point that concedes the whole issue.\nThis was the first time a pope had ever used the political term \u201cgay\u201d.\nNot \u201chomosexual,\u201d not \u201csame-sex attracted,\u201d but \u201cgay,\u201d meaning that he started by adopting the entirety of the homosexualist movement\u2019s linguistic manipulations.\nLanguage counts in politics, and a pope using that term means he is by implication starting the discussion \u2013 and his pontificate \u2013 by aligning himself with the basic tenets of a movement that is violently opposed to Catholic moral teaching, and in direct opposition to his immediate, and still living, predecessor.\nIn this case too, he was addressing a plane load of journalists who were either secular themselves, or for the most part are the kind of Catholic who believes it is fine to \u201cdisagree\u201d with Catholic teaching on sexuality.\nThere are very few \u201cconservative\u201d Catholics in the Vatican journalist pool.\nThis means that his use of this language was a conspiratorial wink and nod to his immediate audience, a sly message to say, \u201cPeople talk all the time about a gay lobby, but you and I both know this is mostly nonsense, propaganda from those people\u2026 those conservatives\u2026We cool and hip people don\u2019t hate gays, do we?\u201d\nThis astonishing departure follows an implied but very clear assertion that Ricca has repented and given up his activity, an assertion that has absolutely no evidence to back it up.\nWe are simply asked to take the pope\u2019s word for it, but given that it follows his astoundingly brazen lie that there was no evidence for Ricca\u2019s homosexual activity in the first place, we can take the assurance for what it seems to be worth.\nNext, after another little inside nudge-nudge-wink-wink joke about the \u201cgay lobby\u201d \u2013 implying (but of course never outright saying) that the whole thing is hysterical nonsense \u2013 we hear a direct contradiction to Catholic teaching from no less a source than his predecessor, Pope Benedict Ratzinger.\n\u201cThe problem is not having this tendency.\u201d Well, actually, your holiness, yes it is, particularly in the case of priests.\nThe \u201ctendency\u201d is called in the same catechism you quote \u201cintrinsically disordered\u201d and Ratzinger was very clear that this \u201ctendency\u201d is a sign of a serious emotional dysfunction that \u201cmust\u201d preclude a man from being ordained.\nSquandering the capital of trust\nA few months ago in a piece for the Remnant, I talked about why the Church (and nearly all human societies) regard lying as a sin:\nA mistake many make about lying is to understand it only in terms of morality.\nBut Thomas makes the point that it is first a matter of metaphysics.\nLying is an act at variance in its essence with the nature of reality.\nThomistic theology teaches that it is by lying that we become most like the devil, and most unlike God, because we are trying to change the nature of reality to suit our own purposes.\nHabitual lying in effect changes you into a different kind of being, one that is by nature an opponent of Truth, ordered against Truth.\nThis of course means that a person whose \u201corientation,\u201d as we might say, is towards falsehood, even when he is at any given moment saying something true, is still servicing his lies.\nHe tells the truth only to continue to control and manipulate reality.\nIt was not by violence, but by lying and manipulation, by issuing half-truths and pretending to be the kind of man he was not, that Shakespeare\u2019s character Iago earned the title of most evil character in English literature.\nHuman beings are naturally ordered towards the truth, and we have to work at assuming a lie.\nThis is why confidence tricksters can be successful, why lying works for getting what you want; people don\u2019t see it coming.\nThe first natural assumption is trust, at least at the basic level of expecting truth most of the time.\nWe therefore instinctively see lying as a betrayal of trust.\nConsidering how much trust the Catholic faithful had in the papacy until about 1965, how much un-earned trust Francis started with just by being elected, this pontificate should be remembered as one of the great confidence scams in history.\nBelieving Catholics have watched aghast as this pope has habitually trampled on every aspect of Catholic teaching.\nSandro Magister recently published a piece on his website that listed in dizzying detail the many times, in only the last few months, that pope Francis has falsified with obvious intention, the words of Christ in Scripture and the teaching of the Church.\nOf course this would be of little interest to secular journalists, who have paid no mind to his habit of rewriting Catholicism, but the sex abuse crisis is something secular journalists are very interested in, a fact Bergoglio seems not to have understood.\nIt is now irrefutable that Pope Bergoglio is a habitual liar \u2013 that in fact truth, like reality, seems to mean nothing to him except as a tool.\nSociologists talk about the concept of the \u201chigh trust society,\u201d one in which citizens believe what they are told by the elites and trust them to govern and protect them adequately.\nThey warn that the general loss of trust in institutions leads to a general state of chaos, in which laws on the books matter little as citizens turn to their last resort of protecting themselves and their own families.\nThis is the way societies disintegrate.\nIt has been said many times that the sex abuse crisis has created a massive loss of trust in prelates among the Catholic faithful, and this is true.\nWith a professional confidence trickster on the papal throne, blatantly using lies and manipulation to maintain power and ram through an agenda at radical variance with Catholic doctrine, how long before that predictable disintegration occurs?\nAre we seeing it already?\nAre we seeing it in the declarations of this or that episcopate on Amoris Laetitia and Communion for divorced and civilly remarried Catholics?\nWith Cardinal Marx and others promoting \u201cblessings\u201d for \u201csame-sex unions\u201d are we going to be seeing an escalation of it?\nI have seen a veritable chorus of Catholics on social media declaring that if Paul VI is canonised, their loss of faith in the Church as an institution will be complete.\nI am told from contacts inside the Vatican that after the trip to Chile Bergoglio\u2019s support has completely dried up.\nHe has no more resources of trust even among the people he has chosen to surround himself with and after the reports of Cardinal Sandri going toe-to-toe with him in a shouting match, it seems that perhaps even his legendary vicious temper tantrums are failing to have the desired effect of terrorising his subordinates into submission.\nMarie Collins, by no stretch even a \u201cconservative\u201d Catholic, echoed this concern, saying the Barros affair has \u201cdefinitely undermined credibility, trust, and hope\u201d in Francis.\n\u201cAll I can say is that people who had a lot of hope in this particular pope, and I am talking about just ordinary Catholics that I know in my own parish, would find it very difficult now\u2026and cannot understand and cannot believe that this particular pope has said the things he has said in the last few weeks,\u201d she told the National Catholic Reporter.\nIt may seem like a moment to enjoy, seeing the apparently unbreachable shell of papal teflon finally cracking, but in reality this situation is potentially very harmful for souls in the long run.\nThere is a multitude of problems this pontificate has created or made worse that we will be dealing with for a long time after Bergoglio is gone, but perhaps one of the bigger ones will be the destruction of trust.\nAlready fractured since the collapse of all Catholic institutions after Vatican II and the horrors of the sex abuse crisis, how much will there be to repair of the once-steadfast trust Catholics instinctively had in the Church after this?\nNotes:\n[1] \u201cNot one victim has come forward in Chile; show me the proof.\nThis is slander and calumny.\nIs that clear?\u201d\n[2] The book \u201cThe Dictator Pope\u201d relates that regular meetings between the pope and dicastery heads have been abolished and even high-ranking curia prefects are often unable to see the pope, whose appointments are now completely controlled by the Secretariat of State.\nIt is certainly clear that no one sees the pope unless Cardinal Parolin approves, which may be the reason Cardinal Zen, in his efforts to warn Francis of the dangers of a Vatican deal with the communist Chinese government had to wait in the rain at a Wednesday general audience.\n[3] This is common in Italian journalism that has somewhat different standards from that of the Anglo world\u2026 and drives the rest of us spare.\nItalians care about getting a general picture of what\u2019s going on, where Anglo-Saxons are considered weirdly obsessed with trivial details.\n[4] Though she never blamed the pope, Marie Collins complained that Vatican officialdom had simply not implemented the Commission\u2019s recommendations.\nThe time limit of the Commission\u2019s members was allowed to lapse without renewal and though it was not dissolved formally the Commission has ceased to function with no word of any plan to revive it.\n[5] Probably a reference to the Inzoli case in which Francis overturned a previous sentence of a Vatican tribunal after the priest \u2013 now laicised \u2013 approached some of the pope\u2019s close advisors for help, including Cardinal Coccopalmerio.\n[6] Not that anyone in Rome was trying very hard.\nSandro Magister reported after the \u201cWho am I to judge\u201d comment, \u201cBefore the appointment, Francis had been shown, as is customary, the personal file on Ricca, in which he had not found anything unseemly.\nHe had also heard from various personalities of the curia, and none of them had raised objections.\u201d\n", ["Repetition", "Thought-terminating_Cliches", "Doubt",

minimums and solar maximums, which are periods where the Sun is either quite calm (the minimum) or incredibly active (the maximum).\nThese patterns repeat every 11 years or so, but new research suggests that there\u2019s a pattern behind the pattern, and that a particularly cool solar minimum is on the way.\nThe study, which was published in Astrophysical Journal Letters, was carried out by a team led by physicist Dan Lubin of the University of California, San Diego.\nAfter combing the data, Lubin\u2019s team has forecasted a grand minimum that will be around seven percent cooler than the typical solar minimum, making it a particularly calm moment for our star.\nDuring a solar minimum, the Sun produces far fewer solar flares and sunspots, and as a result, much less ultraviolet radiation is shot out into space and towards Earth.\nThis can have a number of effects on our planet, including changes in the thickness of the stratospheric ozone layer and temperatures far above ground.\nThose changes can affect weather, though forecasting specific differences has proven difficult.\nThe grand minimum will be an exaggerated version of the typical solar minimum, and could produce some very noticeable effects.\nThe most recent grand minimum is thought to have occurred back in the mid 1600s.\nThe event, called the Maunder Minimum, is credited with plunging temperatures to the point where the Thames River and Baltic Sea froze over.\nHowever, other parts of the planet heated up, including Alaska and Greenland, to far above their normal highs.\nThis temporary shakeup

he\u2019s certain the climate within student government will improve, after a report into the incident was made public this week.\nNoah Lew and two other students were voted off the Students\u2019 Society of McGill University last October after they were identified as having pro-Israel viewpoints.\nThey were since reinstated.\nA report made public this week by Spencer Boudreau concluded he could not determine if students who organized against the three board members had anti-Semitic intentions.\nBoudreau, a retired professor of education and former ombudsperson for students, however, said he understood why the students felt they were targeted because they are Jewish.\nAfter criticism from several Jewish groups both on and off campus, Boudreau issued a clarification to the report, saying he could not determine if the vote was motivated by anti-Semitism, but he acknowledged there were \u201cin fact anti-Semitic effects felt by members of the Jewish community.\u201d\nSpeaking to the Montreal Gazette on Friday, Lew, the SSMU\u2019s vice-president of finance for the Arts, said he was initially upset with the report, but felt vindicated by Boudreau\u2019s clarification.\n\u201cI thought this acknowledgement was very important and I really did appreciate that he clarified the matter,\u201d he said.\nJewish groups had criticized Boudreau\u2019s report, saying it ignored anti-Semitic language used on Facebook by a group called Democratize SSMU.\nThe group was urging students to vote against Lew, and two other board members who were deemed to be pro-Israel, alleging \u201clayers of corruption\u201d within the student government and favouritism in appointing board members, then singled out three members of the board \u201cwho are all either fellows at the Canadian Jewish Political Affairs Committee, an organization whose explicit mandate is to promote pro-Israel discourse in Canadian politics, or primary organizers for the anti-BDS initiative at McGill.\u201d\nBoudreau made his clarification after it was pointed out the anti-Semitic language was published prior to the vote.\nWhile Democratize SSMU later apologized for the language and deleted it from its site, the damage had already been done, Boudreau concluded.\nLew said he feels vindicated to some extent, but is concerned anti-Semitism is still a problem within student government.\n\u201cThere have been some steps taken by the administration and the student body in the right direction, but it\u2019s certainly not over,\u201d he said.\nIn the months leading up to the vote, there had been other anti-Semitic incidents, including a tweet by Igor Sadikov, an elected representative of students in McGill\u2019s faculty of arts, saying: \u201cpunch a zionist.\u201d\nAmong the measures taken by SSMU after the October vote was the creation of a committee looking into the issue of anti-Semitism within the student government, which Lew sits on.\nOn Wednesday, McGill Principal Suzanne Fortier said the University wants to ensure a safe space for all students.\n\u201cI would like to take this opportunity to make it clear that there is absolutely no place for anti-Semitism at McGill University and that, as principal and vice-chancellor, I will remain vigilant to ensure that all members of our community feel safe, welcomed and respected on our campuses.\u201d\nIn addition to ordering the report, Fortier set up a hotline to report incidents of of intolerance and a task force to investigate incidents of academic freedom and equity.\nRabbi Reuben Poupko, the co-chair for Quebec of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, said it should be noted McGill in general is a safe space for Jewish students.\nHowever, he said any Jewish students thinking of being involved in student politics or activism \u201cwill have encounters that are profoundly disturbing and unpleasant.\u201d\nHe said McGill is not alone in this respect, as this is a continent-wide phenomenon within student politics.\nDemocratize SSMU did not respond to a request for an

give in to extortion.\nFor us, Hungary is first.\"\n\u201cWe will fight those who want to change the Christian identity of Hungary and Europe,\u201d Orban concluded.\nAccording to the Hungarian Government's website, posted about the ultimatum that was given over the weekend.\nOver the weekend, Belgian prime minister Charles Michel spoke about sending \u201can ultimatum\u201d to the Visegr\u00e1d countries which \u201creject solidarity\u201d.\nThe essence of this ultimatum would be that if by the end of June a consensus is not reached in the council of EU heads of government, then the planned reforms would be adopted with a qualified majority vote which would overrule dissenters.\nMinister of Foreign Affairs and Trade P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 said on Tuesday,\u201cHungary will not become an immigrant country, it has never admitted and will never admit illegal immigrants.\"\nHe also referred to Michel's ultimatum as unacceptable and shocking.\n\u201cHungary has never admitted and will never admit illegal immigrants, irrespective of whether there is any pressure in this direction along the borders or from Brussels,\u201d Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 said.\n\u201cThe Belgian Prime Minister\u2019s statement is also outrageous because this is the first time that people in Brussels are openly planning to push the mandatory resettlement quota through by force while totally ignoring the will of certain EU member states.\"\n\u201cWe regard this whole thing as unacceptable and we reject it,\" he added.\n\u201cThe countries of the Visegr\u00e1d Group do not support the introduction of any kind of mandatory quota.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps it doesn\u2019t bother the Belgian Prime Minister that there are no-go zones in many Western European cities, or that people with immigrant backgrounds have committed 27 major terrorist attacks in Europe recently, but this bothers the V4 because they do not want to live on a continent were the threat of terrorism becomes an everyday regularity,\" he continued.\nJust this week, we reported that Hungary had grown weary of the talks of pushing illegal Muslim migrants on their country and Europe, and was preparing to walk away from the negotiating table.\nOrban has taken a tough stance in Hungary.\nHe has ordered all illegal Muslim invaders to get out of Hungary and never come back.\nIn December, he said that he was not concerned with what Brussels wanted, but was determined to defend Hungary's borders.\nPM Orban has done just that, too.\nOrban's border wall virtually eliminated illegal immigration.\nOrban is openly Christian and seems to understand something that many do not and that is you do not allow a wholesale flood of antichrists to pour into your country.\nWere the Ammonites and Moabites not kept out of the assembly of Israel because of their hatred of the people of God?\n(Deuteronoy 23:3-6) Yes, they were.\nWhile Muslims need the Gospel for sure, one cannot allow such an influx into the country, or all you are asking for is the judgments God warned about in Deuteronomy 28.\nI say, well done Mr. Orban.\nI would like to hear more of that kind of talk from America's representatives.\n", ["Repetition", "Thought-terminating_Cliches", "Appeal_to_fear-prejudice", "Black-and-White_Fallacy", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling,Labeling",

a disaster recovery package signed on Friday by U.S. President Donald Trump.\nThat money includes nearly $7 billion announced on Wednesday and will help the bankrupt U.S. territory recover from September's Hurricane Maria, according to a statement on Friday from Governor Ricardo Rossello and Jenniffer Gonzalez, Puerto Rico's nonvoting member of the U.S. Congress.\nRossello said on Wednesday that Puerto Rico would get $4.9 billion to shore up its near-insolvent Medicaid system and another $2 billion or so under the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program to repair its destroyed electric grid.\nOn Friday, Rossello and Gonzalez said the island would receive a total of $11 billion under CDBG, a program run by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nThe additional portion would be used to help local businesses and repair and build new homes, they said.\nIn addition to a slow recovery from Hurricane Maria, its worst natural disaster in 90 years, Puerto Rico is navigating the largest bankruptcy in U.S. government history, with a combined $120 billion in bond and pension debt.\nThe aid announced on Friday provides just a fraction of the $94.4 billion Rossello has said the island needs to recover from cataclysmic damage to its infrastructure and housing stock, although Puerto Rico is eligible to participate in other programs that could increase the aid to $45 billion, according to Friday's statement.\nCongress could also appropriate more money later.\nThe governor has asked Congress for $46 billion in CDBG funding alone.\nHome damage in Puerto Rico, where the poverty rate is around 46 percent, was exacerbated by the existence of hundreds of thousands of sub-standard \"informal\" homes, which are typically built by the owners themselves, without permits and often in squatter communities.\n\"The work carried out in Washington - together with resident commissioner Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez - was able to deliver the message of the urgency of an allocation of funds that meets the needs of the Island,\" the governor said in Friday's statement.\nThe disaster aid package signed by Trump on Friday - around $90 billion in total - covers a number of major disasters, including Hurricanes Irma, Harvey and Maria, as well as the recent California wildfires.\n(Reporting by Nick Brown; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters

the phase has almost no effect on global warming.\nPhysicist Dan Lubin at the University of California San Diego and two of his colleges managed to collect and observe relevant data for the past 20 years and came to the conclusion that the giant burning ball of gas in our planetary system might enter a \u201cgrand minimum\u201d period of decreased ultraviolet radiation that would last for some 11 years by mid-century.\n\u201cThe cooldown\u2026 [is] a periodic event during which the Sun\u2019s magnetism diminishes, sunspots form infrequently, and less ultraviolet radiation (UV) makes it to the surface of the planet,\u201d researchers noted in a statement earlier this week, adding that \u201cthe event is triggered at irregular intervals by random fluctuations related to the Sun\u2019s magnetic field.\u201d\nThe study, whose results were published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, said the Sun is likely to be 6.9 percent cooler than its usual lowest amount of activity in the grand minimum.\nAccording to the researchers, the cooldown phase could echo those experienced in Europe in the mid-17th century, called the \u201cMaunder Minimum,\u201d or the prolonged sunspot minimum, during which temperatures were low enough to cause London's River Thames to freeze over on a regular basis and to freeze the Baltic Sea to such an extent that Swedish troops were able to invade Denmark in 1658 on foot by marching across the sea ice.\nHowever, scientists warned that it should not be assumed that the ultra-cooling of the sun would potentially prevent the negative effects of global warming.\n\u201cThe cooling effect of a grand minimum is only a fraction of the warming effect caused by the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,\u201d they said, adding, \u201cAfter hundreds of thousands of years of CO2 levels never exceeding 300 parts per million in air, the concentration of the greenhouse gas is now over 400 parts per million, continuing a rise that began with the Industrial Revolution.\u201d\nThe study estimated that the Sun\u2019s mid-century cooldown would probably only result in cooling the Earth by some 0.25 percent between 2020 and 2070.\nAs a result, the temperature at the surface of our cosmic home would decrease by up to several tenths of a degree Celsius, which is not sufficient to stop global warming, but it could at least soften its effects in part.\n\u201cNow we have a benchmark from which we can perform better climate model simulations.\nWe can therefore have a better idea of how changes in solar UV

Beach, Florida.\nOn January 25th, Zakkout posted onto his personal Facebook page a video clip of a speech made by Steve Anderson, the pastor of the Faithful Word Baptist Church in Tempe, Arizona.\nAnderson is notorious for calling for the killing of gays to end AIDS.\nIn the clip, Anderson states the following: \u201cAnd the Jews were scattered into all nations for literally 2000 years, right?\nFor 1800 sum odd years.\nAnd by the way, everywhere they were scattered, they were persecuted, hated, treated badly.\nWhy?\n\u2018Cause God\u2019s blessing them?\nNo.\n\u2018Cause they\u2019re under the curse of God for having rejected the Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d\nBlaming Jews for the extreme torment they endured for so long, which includes a Nazi Holocaust that took the lives of six million innocent Jews and so many others, is incredibly offensive.\nIndeed, statements and beliefs such as Anderson\u2019s have provoked hatred and persecution of Jews.\nTowards the end of the clip, which is less than four minutes in length, Anderson throws the anti-Semitism in people\u2019s faces.\nHe zealously states, while drawing laughter from his small audience, \u201cYou say, \u2018Why are you preaching against the Jews?\u2019 Well, don\u2019t come back next Wednesday night.\nBecause, next Wednesday night, God\u2019s wrath is on the Jews even more!\u201d\nAbout the clip, on Facebook, Zakkout wrote above it, \u201cMakes a lot of sense!\u201d Of course, this is coming from someone [Zakkout] who regularly refers to Jews as \u201cmonkeys and pigs,\u201d and in February 2016, circulated on social media a report claiming that \u201cthe Holocaust was faked.\u201d The report calls the Holocaust \u201cthe biggest lie ever foisted upon humanity\u201d and was produced by a media outlet which describes Hitler as \u201cthe greatest leader in modern Western history.\u201d\nBoth Anderson and Zakkout have been denounced by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) for their propagation of anti-Semitism.\nIn July 2010, the ADL condemned Zakkout and his group AMANA for featuring an anti-Jewish video produced by former KKK leader and white supremacist David Duke on the AMANA website.\nThe ADL described the video as \u201cvenomous.\u201d In October 2015, Zakkout praised Duke, as \u201cDavid Duke, a man to believe in!\u201d\nBesides posting videos from Steve Anderson and David Duke on his Facebook page, Zakkout also, in July 2017, posted a four minute clip from a speech made by Nation of Islam (NOI) leader Louis Farrakhan.\nDuring the clip, Farrakhan repeatedly

coming face to face with Satan, the Arch Deceiver, the enemy of God, and the enemy of the righteous.\u201d\nZakkout is also an ardent supporter of the terrorist organization Hamas, if not a member himself.\nIn July 2014, he organized a pro-Hamas rally held outside the Israeli Consulate in downtown Miami.\nRally goers repeatedly shouted, \u201cWe are Hamas\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s go Hamas.\u201d After the rally, Zakkout wrote the following in Arabic, above photos from the event: \u201cThank God, every day we conquer the American Jews like our conquests over the Jews of Israel!\u201d He signed it \u201cBr.\nSofian Zakkout.\u201d The next month, Zakkout declared in Arabic, \"Hamas is in my heart and on my head.\"\nAll of the above testifies to hatred and intolerance, but it is even more disturbing given the fact that Zakkout sits on the boards of two anti-crime organizations: Crime Stoppers of Miami-Dade County and Citizens\u2019 Crime Watch of Miami-Dade County.\nServing alongside Zakkout on these boards are local politicians and law enforcement officials.\nOne would think that they would find Zakkout\u2019s actions and bigotry unacceptable, as well, yet Zakkout continues to serve unchallenged.\nIf the board members of Crime Stoppers and Citizens\u2019 Crime Watch do not wish to be associated with anti-Semitism or white supremacism or Hamas or Holocaust denial or Steve Anderson or David Duke or Louis Farrakhan, then they must cut ties with Sofian Zakkout.\nThe time is long overdue that these groups maintain their credibility and remain true to their stated missions of protecting and safeguarding the American public.\nSofian Zakkout\u2019s bigoted and radical agenda is antithetical to this and is a documented threat to national security.\nHis presence on the boards of both organizations constitutes an obscene travesty.\nOnce and for all, these groups need to divorce themselves from Zakkout and repudiate what he stands

Argentina before he became Pope Francis say it is a \u201cclassic\u201d move of his to provide \u201cmercy\u201d to clergy who are sexual predators while asking everybody else to simply \u201cmove on,\u201d said attorney and child advocate Elizabeth Yore on an EWTN show last week.\n\u201cI think this is a misplaced mercy.\nIt is mercy for the predator priests,\u201d she told EWTN\u2019s Raymond Arroyo on the February 8 episode of World Over.\n\u201cThere are many people who know the Pope from Argentina who have said this is classic Bergoglio to provide mercy to the predators and ask everybody else to move on,\u201d she added.\n(See original The World Over program segment on this issue that begins at 47 seconds into the video below)\nYore, who has handled child abuse investigations and clergy abuse investigations throughout her legal career, was commenting on the latest sexual abuse case to touch the Francis papacy, in this case where the Pope appointed a bishop with a history of complicity in child sex abuse.\nThe Pope\u2019s claim that he had never received any victim testimony regarding the complicity of Chilean Bishop Juan Barros in child sex abuse has proven to be false.\n\u201cThe Barros case is putting the Pope, for the first time, in the middle as a principal in a cover-up,\u201d Yore said during the interview.\nYore said that not only is it now known that the Pope received a letter from one of the victims, but it is also now known that he was \u201ctold from the moment he appointed Bishop Barros in 2015 that this was a bad decision.\u201d\n\u201cThe Chilean Archbishop conference told him to revoke this appointment.\nHe received petitions and letters and calls, yet, ignored them all,\u201d she said.\nAs details continue to surface, the pontiff\u2019s professed empathy for abuse victims has come into question as well.\nYore called the child sex abuse case involving infamous Chilean priest abuser Father Fernando Karadima and Bishop Juan Barros \u201ca scandal of epic proportions.\u201d\nThe scandal signals that the Church under Francis is slipping backwards in its handling of abuse, said Yore.\nYore called the example Pope Francis set in the way he handled the abuse information \u201cextremely dangerous.\u201d\n\u201cBut it is extremely dangerous as the head of the Catholic Church \u2014 you know, the last appeal \u2014 that this is the kind of behavior that is going to be mimicked around the world by bishops, [who will say] \u2018Well if the Pope is not going to intervene and impose zero tolerance, why should I?\u2019\u201d\nReports say Pope Francis personally received the eight-page letter from the Chilean victim graphically detailing the alleged abuses by Karadima and linking Barros as having witnessed and covered up the abuse.\nThe alleged abuse took place decades prior to Francis\u2019s 2015 appointment of Barros to the Diocese of Osorno in southern Chile.\nPope Francis received the victim\u2019s letter in 2015, its author and a member of Francis\u2019s sex abuse commission have said, contradicting the Pope\u2019s recent insistence that no victims had come forward in the matter and no evidence had been produced.\nFrancis encountered protests in Chile over his defense of Barros during his visit there last month, calling the accusations against the priest \u201ccalumny.\u201d\nWhile Francis later apologized, he persisted in defending Barros, denying that he had received any testimony himself and restating that such unproven accusations are \u201cslander.\u201d\nThe Pope later said he would send Malta Archbishop Charles Scicluna \u2013 the former top Vatican abuse investigator - to Chile to investigate the matter.\nExpectations were high in 2014 when the Pope created the abuse commission.\nAnd while he has continually condemned clergy sex abuse throughout his pontificate, some have argued his actions in some serious cases don\u2019t match his tough stances on abuse.\nFour members of the commission had met with Cardinal O\u2019Malley in 2015, conveying their objections to Francis\u2019s 2015 appointment of Barros as bishop of Osorno.\nIt was at the meeting with O\u2019Malley that the abuse commission representatives reportedly gave the letter to the cardinal to deliver to Francis, and O\u2019Malley later confirmed to a commission member that he had in fact personally delivered the letter to the Pope.\nYore explained that the Pope has been told from the moment he appointed Barros in 2015 that it was a bad decision, between the Chilean bishops\u2019 conference, petitions, letters and calls, that were all ignored.\nFurther, a Chilean judicial inquiry found all the victims who testified \u2014 including the letter\u2019s author Juan Carlos \u2014 to be credible, and that there was a major cover-up of the abuse by Father Karadima.\nArroyo spoke with Cruz as well, who said he was \u201cincredibly frustrated\u201d when Barros was going to be appointed.\nHe\u2019d testified about three bishops who had witnessed abuse, he said, but Barros had special significance for him because Barros\u2019 part went beyond witnessing the abuse, to violating his seal of Confession with Karadima and psychological abuse through intimidation.\nCruz recounted how he and other victims had been dismissed or slandered by local Church hierarchy for numerous attempts to be heard.\nAnd he spoke about holding out hope that there would be a different response from the Pope, discussing specifics of getting the letter to the Francis via Cardinal O\u2019Malley.\nCruz told Arroyo he was really hurt and felt betrayed by the Pope\u2019s comments that the accusations were slander, and there were no witnesses or evidence.\n\u201cTo hear him talk about us that way,\u201d Cruz said, \u201ccalling us slanderers, it was terrible because it set the clock back for so many victims.\u201d\nScicluna will be meeting with Cruz, who said he hopes other abuse survivors will be heard as a result of his case coming more to the forefront.\n\u201cThis leaves us with very strong evidence that the Pope was, in fact, aware of what has happened,\u201d Yore said.\n\u201cHere we have victims 10, 15 years after their abuse, begging the Pope, having to take pictures of a letter that\u2019s handed to a cardinal to ensure that there is evidence that the Pope is receiving this information.\u201d\nThe whole of Latin America, including Argentina, was well aware of what was happening when this case broke in Chile in 2010, Yore noted, and yet the Pope continues to shrug his shoulders and say he has no information.\nThis was precisely what he\u2019d been saying when he was cardinal and archbishop in Buenos Aires, she said, that no one ever came forward with information, and there were never any cases of clerical abuse in the entirety of the two-million-plus member Archdiocese of Buenos Aires.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just simply a cover-up of a predator priest,\u201d Yore stated.\n\u201cThis is Barros present, in the room when the abuse is ongoing with these young minor boys.\u201d\nShe said she would argue as a child advocate that Barros was involved in sexual exploitation of children.\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t think this is simply just a case, as bad as it is, of a cover-up of an abuser,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThis is also sexual exploitation of children in a grooming gang, a predator priest.\nThis is why it is so heinous.\u201d\nYore said that given the Church\u2019s sex abuse crisis, one would have thought going into the 2013 conclave (which elected Francis) that an obvious priority in vetting candidates for the papacy would have meant a serious look at their history of handling abuse allegations in their previous sees.\nThere are more cases out there just like Barros that have been covered up, Yore told Arroyo, maybe even some even worse than the Barros case.\n\u201cThose cases are going to be haunting this papacy and really causing a rift in the major protection of children that Pope Benedict had worked very hard to really build up,\u201d she said.\n\u201cTrust within the faithful and to put in a system that was going to root out the predators.\nAnd I think that has just been blown up and I think we are back to square one in the Vatican.\"\n", ["Repetition",

rejects German Bishops\u2019 idea of blessing homosexual unions\nNewsCatholic Church\nSALZBURG, Austria, February 13, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) \u2013 The indignation about Cardinal Reinhard Marx and Bishop Franz-Josef Bode \u2013 the President and the Vice President of the German Bishops' Conference \u2013 and their direct or more indirect encouragement of blessing homosexual unions is growing by the day.\nNow Bishop emeritus Andreas Laun \u2013 one of the signatories of the Kazakh \u201cProfession of Truth about Sacramental Marriage\u201d \u2013 has written a strong commentary for the Austrian Catholic news website Kath.net on the recent episcopal initiatives coming out of Germany.\nIn the following, we shall present to our readers the essential parts of Bishop Laun's statement, in our English translation from the German.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDear Cardinal Marx and dear Bishop Bode, there is only one Catholic answer: No!\nAnd your addition \u201cin individual cases\u201d is absolutely worthless, it has no argumentative force.\nA clear statement by Bishop Andreas Laun for Kath.net.\nCardinal Marx and also Bishop Bode have now opened up to the idea to offer homosexual couples a blessing.\nWhy not, one could say, since the Church is ready to bless nearly everything on the earth?\nNow, the Church especially blesses people, but also deeds and objects.\nThe Jesuit Father Eckhard Bieger writes in the Internet about Catholic blessings:\nFor Catholics, really everything can be blessed, not only places of worship, chalices, and the faithful after each prayer service \u2013 whether after a Mass, or after the prayers for the hours of the day.\nThe blessing is also not limited to rosaries or religious medal, but one may also bless cars, factory halls, animals, herbs, and much more.\nSome blessings are only to be made by priests and deacons, especially when it is about objects of worship such as chalices or vestments.\nBut parents can bless their children.\nThe faithful may also take home holy water and sprinkle it on members of the family, but also the stable and the animals, thus blessing them.\n[...]\nWhat kind of hope is connected with a blessing?\nWith regard to the car, certainly the wish for heavenly protection \u2013 sometimes also expressed with the help of a medal of St. Christopher, the patron saint of car drivers.\nWith the weather blessing, one prays explicitly for protection against hail, lightning and drought.\n[\u2026]\nTo bless always means that something shall flourish, because only then when there is a blessing upon a cause or a project, will something good come out of it.\nThe blessing comes from God, He is being addressed in the form of a request; and it is given to people, objects, and buildings, with the help of the sign of the cross, holy water, and incense.\n[\u2026]\nBut now concerning the question of Cardinal Marx, and not a few of the priests, the answer is simple: one may ask for God's blessing for sinners, but not for the sin.\nThat is to say, one could not consecrate a brothel, one could not bless a concentration camp or weapons which are not explicitly ordained for hunting or for legitimate self-defense.\nTherefore it is clear that one may not bless a relationship which is sinful; [one may not bless] the mafia; no blessing for organizations or institutions which promote or procure abortions or which propagate ideologies which are against the Faith, antisemitic contents, or other forms of racist thought.\nIf one considers and weighs this matter, one knows: one may not bless a union of two homosexual men or of lesbian women.\nOf course [one could bless] two men or women who are de facto homosexual, and that it what happens in each Holy Mass which is being attended by them.\nThis blessing \u2013 which is not related to their acts \u2013 is being received also by all the other sinners, and the Church thereby hopes that they will convert under the influence of God's Grace!\nThis position which is really simple and easily to be understood has been clearly and convincingly presented \u2013 since the statement of the two bishops [Marx and Bode] \u2013 by several Christians: by Archbishops Ludwig Schick (Germany) and Charles Chaput (USA); by the German-speaking theologians Hubert Windisch and Markus B\u00fcning.\nI am sure there are many many others, too, who think alike, but whom I do not know.\nDear Cardinal Marx and dear Bishop Bode, there is only one Catholic answer: No!\nAnd your addition \u201cin individual cases\u201d is absolutely worthless, it has no argumentative force.\nWhat would St. John the Baptist have said if Herod, taking for himself his brother's wife, would have excusingly called himself an \u201cindividual case\u201d!\nThe idea to bless sinful conduct is really what Isaiah described quite vividly, as follows: \u201cWoe to you that call evil good, and good evil: that put darkness for light, and light for darkness: that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter.\u201d [Isaiah 5:20]\nIs this not exactly what Cardinal Marx \u2013 and others who are thinking like him \u2013 are doing?\nIf one were to place on a bottle of sour cucumbers a tag \u201choney,\u201d the cucumbers still remain sour!\nEven blessing bishops cannot change that.\nNor can the pope, in calling for a cultural revolution, especially since he does not explain what he exactly means by it.\nHe says that he \u201callows himself\u201d to talk like that \u2013 but if one dares something, one might win, but one also can perish.\nThat seems to catch on these days.\nFor example, the Italian moral theologian, Maurizio Chiodi, recently claimed in his talk at the Gregorian Pontifical University that contraception is sometimes not only not forbidden, but even demanded!\nTo contradict two popes \u2013 whom the Church has already \u201cbeatified\u201d the one and \u201ccanonized\u201d the other \u2013 so shortly after their deaths, and in such a radical and open manner, probably has never happened before in the Church's history.\nIsaiah says that such people draw unto them God's punishment, with thick cords!\nNevertheless, one should wish for Cardinal Marx, Bishop Bode, and Professor Chiodi that they sleep well.\nWhether their conscience will allow it, is not so certain; but if it does not [allow it], it would certainly be a hope for their conversion.\n", ["Repetition", "Thought-terminating_Cliches", "Appeal_to_fear-prejudice",

homosexual couples would be an \u2018atrocity\u2019\nNewsCatholic Church\nBRATISLAVA, Slovakia, February 13, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) \u2013 Former Vatican doctrine chief Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig M\u00fcller has decried the Church's current adaptation to the modern world and rejected the idea of blessing homosexual couples.\nThe remarks, made in a February 6 talk in Slovakia, indirectly respond to new initiatives coming from Germany, especially from Cardinal Reinhard Marx and Bishop Franz-Josef Bode.\nCardinal M\u00fcller, former Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, spoke at a conference on John Paul II's encyclical Veritatis Splendor at the Comenius University in Bratislava, organized by the Slovakian Bishops' Conference.\nIn remarks after his address, reported by the German Catholic newspaper Die Tagespost, the cardinal made it clear what he thinks about the recently presented German idea of blessing homosexual unions, even if only in individual cases: \u201cIf a priest blesses a homosexual couple, then this is an atrocity at a holy site, namely, to approve of something that God does not approve of.\u201d\nAccording to the Tagespost report, Cardinal M\u00fcller said in his address that he regrets the separation of the Church's doctrinal and moral teaching and called Christianity a \u201ctheocentric humanism.\u201d He said the \u201csubmissive change of the Church into a NGO for the embetterment of the this-worldly life conditions\u201d is a \u201csuicidal modernization\u201d that denies mankind the Truth of God.\nIn this context, the German cardinal also criticized Martin Luther's own denial of man's free will and his teaching about the total depravity of man that separates morality from the relationship with God.\nMorality, M\u00fcller explained, is rooted in Grace; that is why any teaching about \u201crules and exceptions\u201d ignores the character of the ethics of the Covenant and of Grace.\nIn the discussion following his talk, Cardinal M\u00fcller also responded to questions concerning Pope Francis' post-synodal exhortation, Amoris Laetitia.\nThe cardinal said that he is \u201cnot happy\u201d about the fact that there are different interpretations of this papal text by some bishops' conferences.\n\u201cIn dogmatic questions, there cannot be a plurality,\u201d he added.\nThere is only one Magisterium, he said, and bishops' conferences can only decide about pastoral questions.\nContradictory conceptions concerning the Sacraments, said the cardinal, lead into chaotic conditions.\nThus, explained the cardinal, the Sacraments have to be celebrated the way Christ Himself willed it when he instituted them.\nThe controversial eighth chapter of Amoris Laetitia has to be understood \u201cin an orthodox way,\u201d namely that \u201che who lives in the state of mortal sin cannot receive Holy Communion.\u201d It is, in M\u00fcller's eyes, the pope's duty \u201cto unite the Church, that is what the pope is there for.\u201d This is what he, M\u00fcller, himself told the pope: when the bishops' conferences present different interpretations of Amoris Laetitia, the Church enters \u201cinto a situation like the one before the Reformation.\u201d\nArchbishop Stanislav Zvolensy, President of the Slovakian Bishops' Conference and archbishop of Bratislava, told Die Tagespost that Veritatis Splendor is not only still valid, but shows timeless truths.\nPromulgated 25 years ago, the encyclical rejects authoritatively the theory of situation ethics, a theory that seems to be getting again much attention in our time, for example by theologians such as Professor Maurizio Chiodi.\nProfessor Livio Melina, the former President of the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and the Family, was another speaker at the February 6 conference.\nHe stressed that Amoris Laetitia has to be \u201cread in the context of the magisterial instructions of the encyclical Veritatis Splendor, which recalls the connection between conscience and truth, as well as the necessity of a well-formed conscience.\u201d In returning to that encyclical, explained the Italian professor and theologian, Amoris Laetitia could be given a hermeneutic in light of a \u201ccontinuity with the Magisterium of the Church.\u201d He also said: \u201cThe Commandments are an expression of the Love of God for us.\nIf we fulfill them, we are united with God.\u201d\n", ["Black-and-White_Fallacy", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling,Labeling", "Appeal_to_Authority"]], ["60

\u2013 The Diocese of Linz, Austria, invited homosexual couples to participate in the blessing of couples on St. Valentine's Day.\nThe move comes in the wake of the recent debate over the German bishops' initiative to bless homosexual couples, as well as the controversy over Bishop Andreas Laun's own criticism of it.\nThe diocese\u2019s own media report makes a reference to Amoris Laetitia, as well as to Cardinal Reinhard Marx's recent initiative.\nThe official diocesan newspaper, KirchenZeitung, announced on February 9 that in two different parishes in the Diocese of Linz homosexual couples were explicitly invited to receive a Church blessing on St. Valentine's Day.\nAs is explained in the article:\nSt. Valentine is known as the saint of friendship and of love.\nIn many parishes and ecclesial institutions, it is already tradition to offer blessings of couples around the time of his feast day.\nPeople in homosexual relationships are welcome at the blessing ceremonies in Wels-St. Franziskus [Church] and in the Ursulinenkirche.\nPaul St\u00fctz, the author of the article, explains that the blessing of couples \u201coffers an occasion to express love.\u201d\n\u201cThe blessing expresses that one is welcomed by one's partner and by God.\u201d At the end of his article, he adds a link to another report about Cardinal Reinhard Marx's recent 3 February interview showing his openness to the idea of blessings of homosexual couples in individual cases as decided by a pastor.\nSt\u00fctz also quotes in the article itself Father Franz Harant, \u201ca pastoral worker in the field of marriage and the family\u201d at the Ursulinenkirche in Linz.\nHarant himself shows himself a supporter of blessings for homosexual couples, and he makes here an explicit reference to Amoris Laetitia.\nAs St\u00fctz reports:\nWe give out that universally available blessing.\nThere, we have nothing to forbid,\u201d says Harant.\nHe sees himself in this in union with Pope Francis who himself says in his magisterial document Amoris Laetitia that \u201ceach person, independent of his sexual orientation, is to be respected in his dignity and welcomed with respect.\nAs the Austrian Catholic website Kath.net writes, Harant must be quoting here AL 250.\nIrmgard Lehner, the pastoral assistant of the Wels-St. Franziskus Church, the other of the two parishes that welcome homosexual couples, appreciates this blessing ritual for Valentine's Day, saying it has \u201can enormous power.\u201d During the ceremony, couples come forward in church and receive a hand on their foreheads and a sign of the cross.\n\u201cWe thus stress the high value of relationships,\u201d explains Lehner.\nAs the KirchenZeitung journalist adds: \u201cThis offer can be accepted by lovers in all kinds of life situations \u2013 also by lesbians and homosexuals.\u201d Lehner, who is herself a theologian, regrets that, so far, no homosexual couple has come for the blessing.\n\u201cHere with us, everybody should feel welcome, just as he or she is.\u201d The pastoral assistant adds that \u201cGod is love.\nThere are no restrictions.\u201d\nThe Diocesan Working Group on Pastoral Care for Homosexuals (dahop) is rejoicing about such a welcome from a parish.\nThe group says that it repeatedly receives requests from homosexual couples who wish to \u201creceive a blessing in the frame of a liturgy.\u201d\nThe KirchenZeitung then quotes a commentary, saying:\nIt would be good if a clear sign of openness and invitation would be made by many more pastoral workers [male and female], in order to give the clear signal that love between two persons with equal rights are wished by God and thus already blessed.\nMoreover, the above-quoted Franz Harant himself is the contact person of this Diocesan Working Group \u2013 also called \u201cRainbow Pastoral.\u201d As can be seen on the website of dahop, the Diocese of Linz offers special liturgical services for homosexuals, called \u201cQueer Church Services\u201d (Queer-Gottesdienste) that take place in Harant's own parish.\nIt is not clear whether these church services take place in a form of a Holy Mass.\nSimilar blessings for homosexual couples are currently taking place, or are being considered, also in Gemany, some of them on the diocesan level, some of them on an individual level.\nAs LifeSiteNews reported in January, the Diocese of Limburg is publicly discussing the establishment of a special liturgical rite for the blessing of homosexuals.\nPublicly presented by Johannes zu Eltz, a high-ranking priest of the diocese, his so-called Frankfurt proposal has the public support of the local bishop, Georg B\u00e4tzing.\nAdditionally, the Austrian Catholic website Kath.net reports that there are two Catholics priests in two different German dioceses who publicly state now to have given many blessings to homosexual couples.\nFather Christoph Simonsen (Diocese of Aachen) says that he has blessed 50 couples in the last fifteen years; Father Siegfried Modenbach (Archdiocese of Paderborn) has blessed two homosexual couples in the last years.\nHe also conducts church services for homosexuals.\nKath.net subsequently contacted both Dioceses and requested information about these two priests.\nAs an answer, they were told that the Diocese intends to talk with the concerned priests, but that this matter needs to be addressed among the German bishops in general, such as in the German Bishops' Conference.\nThis moral turmoil in German dioceses has provoked concern and criticism among Catholics.\nMathias von Gersdorff, German pro-life activist and book author, states on his own blog, the upcoming Spring Assembly of the German Bishops' Conference will become crucial in this matter.\nAs he sees it, \u201cthe bishops of Germany who will meet next week for the Spring Assembly of the Bishops' Conference find themselves in a complicated situation,\u201d where they will have to show their colors.\nThey will either be in favor of the Catholic Church's teaching on sexuality and marriage and forbid such blessings, or \u201cessentially accept them,\u201d at least by \u201csaying nothing.\u201d\nHe concludes:\n", ["Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority"]], ["Cardinal O\u2019Malley will head revived Vatican abuse panel\nCardinal Sean O\u2019Malley has been

2018 elections\n(Fixes dateline)\n* PM Orban faces elections on April 8, leads all polls\n* Migration has been Orban's defining theme since 2015\n* Says will counter globalism alongside U.S., UK, Israel\nBy Marton Dunai\nBUDAPEST, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Hungarian leader Viktor Orban called on Sunday for a global alliance against migration as his right-wing populist Fidesz party began campaigning for an April 8 election in which it is expected to win a third consecutive landslide victory.\nPopular at home but increasingly at odds politically and economically with mainstream European Union peers, Orban has thrived on external controversy, including repeated clashes with Brussels and lately the United Nations.\nThose conflicts, mostly centred on migration since people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa flooded into Europe in 2015, have intensified as the elections approach and Orban poses as a saviour of Europe's Christian nations.\n\"Christianity is Europe's last hope,\" Orban told an audience of party faithful at the foot of the Royal Castle in Budapest.\nWith mass immigration, especially from Africa, \"our worst nightmares can come true.\nThe West falls as it fails to see Europe being overrun.\"\nOrban is widely credited for reversing an economic slump in Hungary and controlling its public finances, culminating in a return to investment-grade for its debt, which was cut to 'junk' during the 2008 global economic crisis.\nTo achieve that and hold onto power the prime minister, 54, has used methods that critics have called authoritarian, and picked fights with EU partners, especially in the West.\nEastern leaders, most notably in Poland, have followed his lead.\nBut migration dominates his agenda now.\nOrban said on Sunday that Europe faces a critical fissure between nation states of the East and the West, which he called an \"immigrant zone, a mixed population world that heads in a direction different from ours\".\nAs the West wants eastern Europe to follow its lead, an increasingly vicious struggle was likely, he said, alluding to a plan to redraw the European alliance advocated by the leaders of France and Germany.\n\"Absurd as it may sound the danger we face comes from the West, from politicians in Brussels, Berlin and Paris,\" Orban said to loud applause.\n\"Of course we will fight, and use ever stronger legal tools.\nThe first is our 'Stop Soros' law.\"\nOrban has for years targeted Hungarian-born U.S. financier George Soros, whose philanthropy aims to bolster liberal and open-border values -- anathema to Orban, an advocate of a loose group of strong nation states that reject multiculturalism.\nThe Hungarian leader has advocated \"ethnic homogeneity\" and compared Soros, a Jew, to a puppet master unleashing immigration onto Europe to undermine its cultural and economic integrity.\nA defining moment of his premiership came in 2015, as the migrant crisis peaked: he built a double razor wire fence that became the symbol of anti-migrant sentiment in Europe.\nOrban also said the Hungarian opposition had failed to heed the call of history when it opposed his toughness on migrants.\nVoters have responded favourably and Orban is a clear leader of all polls.\nPOWERFUL ALLIES\nOrban has conflated the issue of immigration with the image of Soros, 87, whose name was used in a tough anti-migrant bill sent to Parliament on Wednesday.\nSoros, for his part, compared Orban unfavourably to both the Nazis and the Communists, saying his rule evoked dark tones from the 1930's -- when Hungary was allied with Nazi Germany -- and was more oppressive than Cold War Soviet occupation.\nOrban has tightened the screws on non-government organisations, particularly ones funded by Soros, and attempted to close a prominent Soros-founded university.\nAttributing to Soros a recent United Nations plan on creating a global blueprint to handle the migration crisis, Orban said he anticipated that powerful allies would help him prevent the U.N. from greasing the wheels of migration.\n\"Soros has antagonised not only us but also England, President Trump and Israel too,\" he said.\n\"Everywhere he wants to get migration accepted.\nIt won't work.\nWe are not alone and we will fight together ... and we will succeed.\"\nIn Europe, he cited as allies Hungary's fellow Visegrad countries Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland, whose ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party is also often at loggerheads with the EU.\nHe said a victory for Silvio Berlusconi's party in Italy's March 4 election would strengthen the nationalist fold.\n\"We don't think the fight is hopeless, on the contrary, we are winning,\" Orban said.\n\"The V4 is firm, Croatia has come around, Austria has turned in the patriotic direction, and in Bavaria the CSU has created a resistance.\"\n(Reporting by Marton Dunai; Editing by Catherine Evans)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\n",

for protecting minors and vulnerable adults, in order that we may do everything possible to ensure that crimes such as those which have occurred are no longer repeated in the Church.\u201d\nWhy is it being renewed now?\nAfter the commission\u2019s three-year mandate expired in December, Francis relaunched it on Feb. 17 with some members reappointed and nine new members added, some of whom are victims of abuse, although the Vatican declined to say which, opting to respect their privacy.\nO\u2019Malley returns as chief.\nNew members come from Australia, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, the Netherlands and Tonga, \"reflecting the global reach of the church and the challenge of creating safeguarding structures in diverse cultural context,\u201d the Vatican said.\nWhat did the first commission achieve?\nThe Vatican has said it \u201cworked with almost 200 dioceses and religious communities worldwide to raise awareness and to educate people on the need for safeguarding in our homes, parishes, schools, hospitals, and other institutions.\u201d\nWhat didn\u2019t it do?\nCommission members quickly realized they needed to go beyond raising awareness and deal with the bishops who quietly shift offenders to new dioceses when they are exposed as molesters and rapists.\nEven if church laws already existed to hold bishops accountable for their priests\u2019 behavior, those strictures were not enough, O\u2019Malley said in 2014.\n\u201cThere are, theoretically I guess, canons that could apply here, but obviously they have not been sufficient,\u201d he said.\nThe commission was behind Francis\u2019 decision in 2015 to create a new tribunal to judge bishops caught covering up for abusive priests, and to fund it for five years.\nBut amid myriad legal questions over what exact powers the court would have, it never got off the ground.\nIn 2016, Francis officially killed the plan to create it, issuing a document that essentially called on using existing procedures to tackle the problem.\nFrancis was also criticized when Australian Cardinal George Pell, whom he had brought to Rome to clean up Vatican finances, was forced to return to Australia last year to face charges of sexual assault.\nAny other problems?\nCommission members said bishops should call the police when they discovered predator priests, rather than phone the nearest religious retreat to \u201cpark\u201d the priest out of harm\u2019s way.\nBut this simple message was hard to get across.\nIt emerged that during a Vatican training course for new bishops in September 2015 a French priest informed bishops they had no obligation to report abuse to the police, forcing the commission to issue a strong statement saying bishops had every obligation to do so.\nDid commission members persevere?\nNot all of them.\nBritish member Peter Saunders, a former victim of priestly abuse, was ousted in 2016.\nHe said the group was a toothless, paper-shuffling exercise.\nIrish member Marie Collins, another victim, resigned in March last year and said Vatican bureaucrats had refused to comply with the commission\u2019s request \u2014 approved by the pope \u2014 to respond to all letters sent to the Vatican by abuse victims.\nMarie Collins, then a member of the pope's sex abuse commission, in 2015 hands a letter to Cardinal Sean O'Malley detailing the abuse suffered by Juan Carlos Cruz of Chile.\nCatherine Bonnet / Associated Press\nWas the pope listening to the commission?\nPossibly not.\nIn 2015, Collins handed O\u2019Malley a letter addressed to the pope from Juan Carlos Cruz, a Chilean abused as a boy by Chilean prelate Fernando Karadima, who was sentenced by the Vatican to a lifetime of penance in 2010.\nCruz described how the abuse was witnessed and covered up by Juan Barros, a priest whose appointment as a bishop in 2015 prompted huge protests in Chile.\nThe pope has stuck by Barros, dismissing the protesters as \u201clefties\u201d and hugging Barros publicly during his visit to Chile last month.\n\"I can't condemn [Barros] because I don't have evidence,\" he said on the plane back to Rome, suggesting he had ignored or never read the letter from Cruz.\nThat was too much for O\u2019Malley, who said Francis had caused \"great pain\u201d to victims.\nIf Francis was not listening to the commission about Barros, whom was he listening to?\nVatican watchers believe the pope was influenced by Chilean Cardinal Francisco Javier Errazuriz, a member of the G9 group who has backed Barros and reportedly helped block moves to make Cruz a member of the abuse commission.\nSo is the pope intransigent on Barros?\nNo.\nSomething changed his mind after his Chilean trip, possibly the scale of the protest against Barros in the country.\nOn Feb. 17, he sent a senior Vatican sex abuse investigator, Archbishop Charles Scicluna, to New York to interview Cruz, who now lives in Philadelphia.\n\"For the first time I felt that someone is listening,\" Cruz said after the meeting.\nWhat happens next?\n\u201cThis should lead to Barros stepping down,\u201d said Saunders, who is forming his own campaign group with Cruz and others to fight clerical abuse.\nThe new papal commission will meanwhile hold its first meeting in April.\nSupport our journalism Please consider subscribing today to support stories like this one.\nGet full access to our signature

police to seek an extreme risk protection order \u2013 or \u2018erpo\u2019 \u2013 which allows law enforcement to legally remove guns from people deemed a danger to themselves or others.\n\u201cIn this case, the man refused to comply.\nBecause of the new law, police were then able to return with a warrant and force the man to surrender the firearm.\u201d\n\u201cA few dozen erpos have been served and executed around the state, but Seattle police said they are the only agency so far to seize a gun because the owner refused to hand it over.\n\u201cLaw enforcement professionals said these specialized protection orders could be a common sense strategy to try and prevent mass shootings \u2013 such as what happened in Parkland, Florida.\n\u201c\u2018There\u2019s certainly a big concern of the connection between mental health and people exhibiting violent behavior and whether or not they should have access to firearms.\nThe \u201cerpos\u201d give us that tool now as an option,\u2019 said Sgt.\nEric Pisconski, who leads the crisis response unit for the Seattle Police Department.\n\u201cThe confiscations only last a year, although they can be renewed.\u201d\nSee the report here:\nSeattle Police First In State To Seize Gun Under Mental Health Law\nA few observations are in order here:\nFirst, the open carry of a firearm is LEGAL in the area where this took place.\nSo, the fellow was violating NO gun laws whatsoever.\nPlus, he never removed the pistol from its holster or brandished it in any way.\nSecondly, the man was \u201cknown\u201d to nearby bars and restaurants near his place of residence.\nThat means nothing.\nKnown for what?\nThe report doesn\u2019t even say the man was known for acting weirdly or strangely.\nIt just says he was \u201cknown.\u201d And even if he did act weirdly or strangely, if we denied constitutional rights to everyone in that category, a majority of Americans would have no rights, and ALL of Congress would have no rights.\nThirdly, what does \u201cvolume of complaints\u201d mean?\nHow many complaints were received over a YEAR\u2019S time?\nTwo?\nFive?\nTen?\nPeople complaining about other people happens all of the time.\nPlus, if complaints had been received over the course of an entire year and police just now decided to act, the man must not have been considered much of a threat.\nFourthly, there was NO report of the man \u201cexhibiting violent behavior,\u201d as the police sergeant claims.\nThe report says \u201che had been intimidating people.\u201d How?\nNo specifics except to say he was \u201cstaring\u201d at people.\nWow!\nRun for your lives!\nFifthly, a U.S. citizen who has committed NO CRIME is denied his Natural right of self-defense for a whole year.\nAnd the media report says the confiscations \u201conly\u201d last a year, with the caveat that they may be extended.\nIndeed.\nThey could and very likely will be extended indefinitely.\nHow many defenseless (unarmed) people are robbed, assaulted, accosted, beaten up, raped, wounded, paralyzed, or killed in a year\u2019s time?\nIt seems many politicians (and many police officers themselves) will not be content until every American citizen is totally defenseless and unable to protect him or herself.\nI tell you this with all seriousness: At some point, the American people will be forced to view these governmental attacks against our Second Amendment liberties as a declaration of war.\nSixthly, the man quoted in the news story who had complained about the armed fellow did so because he said he didn\u2019t like the sight of the man carrying a firearm, as it made him \u201cafraid.\u201d\nSO WHAT?\nThat the mere sight of a law-abiding citizen openly carrying a sidearm would make someone \u201cafraid\u201d is not sufficient reason to deny the citizen his constitutional right to keep and \u201cbear\u201d arms.\nThis \u201cI\u2019m offended\u201d or \u201chis gun scares me\u201d complaint is nothing but cover for little Nazis to try and deny another person their Natural, God-given liberty.\nBut under this new \u201cred flag\u201d law in Washington State, police are now able to confiscate a person\u2019s firearm without the person committing ANY crime\u2014or even threatening to commit a crime.\nEven when police forced the man to surrender his firearm, the man made no threatening gesture toward the officers.\nGun confiscation has started in America\u2014and President Trump\u2019s Stalinist statements about taking guns first and worrying about due process later is the banner under which this is happening.\nWhen Trump promised to add \u201cmental health\u201d regulations to gun purchases and ownership, he opened Pandora\u2019s Box.\nI go into the \u201cmental health\u201d trap in more detail in this column:\nTrump Set To Enact More Gun Control\n\u201cMental health\u201d regulations for gun ownership is what extremist gun grabbers Schumer, Pelosi, Feinstein, et al., have been trying to accomplish for decades.\nNow, it is the \u201cpro-gun\u201d Republican President Donald Trump who is the one making it happen.\nKris Kobach is the Secretary of State of Kansas.\nHe is a former professor of constitutional law at UMKC Law School.\nHe wrote an excellent analysis of the constitutional violations of these \u201cred flag\u201d laws:\nThe seizure of guns without any hearing at all.\nThe laws all contain an \u201cex parte\u201d provision that allows the state to temporarily seize a person\u2019s guns without even notifying the gun owner or giving him a chance to be heard.\nThis is the quintessential denial of due process.\nThe Fourth Amendment makes clear that a person cannot be denied of liberty (to exercise one\u2019s constitutional right to bear arms) without due process of law.\nThis confiscation is \u201ctemporary,\u201d but it can easily lead to long-term or permanent confiscation.\nBased on the testimony of one unrelated person.\nThe confiscation order can be based on the testimony of only one person claiming that the gun owner poses a risk to the safety of himself or others.\nThe law deceptively says that it has to be the testimony of a \u201cfamily member.\u201d [Most of the \u201cred flag\u201d laws, such as the one in Washington State, do not limit who can claim the gun owner poses a risk to the safety of himself or others to family members.]\nBut \u201cfamily member\u201d is defined to include \u201cformer dating partners\u201d and anyone who has ever lived with the defendant.\nSo a jilted former boyfriend or girlfriend, or even a roommate from years ago, could easily set in motion the disarming of a lawful gun owner.\nUsing a very low standard of proof.\nThe standard for obtaining an ex parte order against a gun owner is absurdly low \u2013 one need only show \u201creasonable cause\u201d to believe that the person may pose a risk.\nThat\u2019s even lower than the \u201cprobable cause\u201d standard for obtaining a search warrant.\nIn addition, the judge is forced to rush his decision and issue the confiscation order on the same day of the ex parte hearing.\nWithin two weeks of the ex parte hearing, a hearing with the gun owner present must occur; the purpose is to put in place a long-term confiscation order.\nBut even at that hearing, the standard of proof is far below the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard used in criminal trials.\nRather, it need only be shown by \u201ca preponderance of evidence\u201d that the person poses a risk of injury to self or others.\nWhat kind of evidence?\nThings like the \u201creckless storage\u201d of firearms and drinking habits can be considered.\nIf you keep a handgun in the bedside table and drink beer regularly, you may [be] in trouble.\nShifting the burden of proof to the gun owner.\nThe long-term confiscation order lasts up to a year, but may be renewed indefinitely.\nOnce it is in place, it becomes very difficult to remove.\nTo have the confiscation order lifted, the gun owner must provehe does not pose a threat to himself or others.\nProving a negative is nearly impossible.\nAdding insult to injury, the bill even authorizes local law enforcement to charge the gun owner a storage fee for confiscating and storing his guns.\nAfter the Parkland school shooting, had Donald Trump simply used his bully pulpit to promote arming teachers and school employees as a deterrent and defense against these school shootings without calling for more gun control, it would have been a HUGE boost for the Second Amendment in general and school safety in particular.\nInstead, Trump fell in with anti-Second Amendment liberals and started calling for more gun control, adding \u201cmental health\u201d restrictions to gun purchases and making his stupid Stalinist statements about taking guns first and worrying about due process later.\nAs a result, anti-gun liberals all over the country are using Trump\u2019s own words and proposed gun control policies as a rallying cry to enact gun confiscation laws.\nAs it stands right now, Donald Trump has opened the door for more damage being done to the Second Amendment than any other president, Democrat or Republican, in our lifetime.\nFreedomists in the 50 states had better keep a close eye on their State legislatures this year and next, because, thanks to Donald Trump, gun confiscation is going to be on the agenda in virtually every single State in the country.\nAnd while you are at it, don\u2019t overlook the federal Congress.\nNo wonder Dianne Feinstein looked so deliriously (and devilishly) happy when Trump uttered his stupid comment about gun confiscation and said he wanted to bring an assault weapons ban (Feinstein\u2019s bill) into proposed gun control legislation.\nSee the video here:\nWatch Dianne Feinstein Erupt With Glee After Trump Seems To Endorse Her Assault Weapons Ban\nBut if you are a freedom-loving American who values your liberties and the God-given right to defend them, happy is NOT what you should be feeling right now.\nYou should be OUTRAGED at Donald Trump, and you should be absolutely determined to be ever vigilant against ANY attempt from Democrats or Republicans from federal, State, or municipal government to enact further restrictions against your right to keep and bear arms\u2014because Trump has opened the door not only for more gun control but also for gun confiscation.\nP.S.\nOne more time I want to remind readers that self-defense\u2014including defense against tyrannical government\u2014is more than a right guaranteed in the Second Amendment to our Constitution; it is a duty assigned us in Nature by our Creator.\nFor anyone, especially a Christian, to willingly surrender their means of self-defense is not only a crime against liberty; it is a sin against God.\nI urge my Christian friends (and anyone else) to read the book my constitutional attorney son and I wrote entitled \u201cTo Keep or Not To Keep: Why Christians Should Not Give Up Their Guns.\u201d\nMark it down: Any law demanding the citizenry to surrender their AR-15 rifles would be unconstitutional, unnatural, and unbiblical.\nAnd NO Christian or other free man should ever comply with such a law.\nI know that there is a plethora of pastors who teach that Christians ought to obey the government should it outlaw our guns.\nTHEY ARE WRONG.\nThey are wrong biblically, constitutionally, and morally.\nOur book shows the Natural and Biblical duty of self-defense.\nI don\u2019t know of another book like it.\nWith all that is happening today, it is CRUCIAL that people (especially Christians) become familiar with the truths contained in this book.\nI urge you to order one for yourself and one (at least) for your friends and

of a \u201cconservative\u201d Catholic magazine asked me if I would be interested in contributing a piece about the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, five years on.\nI declined, telling him that I was morally certain that anything I had to say about it would not be in keeping with his editorial policies.\nIt\u2019s been five years, and I\u2019ve noticed that there are a lot fewer people talking about what a \u201ccourageous\u201d act it was to give up the pontificate.\nThe consequences of that act have been so outlandish \u2013 even for people who are mostly OK with Francis \u2013 that very few people are still willing to make polite noises about it.\nEditor's Note: In a March 11th letter signed by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI and addressed to Msgr.\nDario Vigano, prefect of the Secretariat for Communications, the former pope reportedly offers an impassioned defense of Pope Francis against the claim that he lacks theological and philosophical formation.\nIn no uncertain terms, this letter, bearing Benedict's signature, affirms that \u201cthere is an internal continuity between the two pontificates.\u201d Whether Benedict actually wrote this letter or not, it gives rise to a number of grave questions that need to be answered rather urgently before history closes the book on this commedia diabolica.\nOur thanks to Remnant columnist, Hilary White, for addressing the most pertinent of these here below.\nMJM\nIn fact, five years after the resignation of Pope Benedict the Catholic faithful mostly want to know why; why would a pope \u2013 a man with decades of up-close-and-personal experience of the \u201cfilth\u201d in the Curia and throughout the church \u2013 suddenly just decide to quit?\nWhy would he choose to walk away knowing that his task was not completed?\nAt the time and since then, particularly in light of what has been happening, it seems one of the most bizarre aspects of this whole bizarre situation that the reasons offered have been so trivial, so inappropriately, so disproportionately petty.\nThese absurd responses to serious questions of grave import have raised the inescapable suspicion that Benedict simply did not take the papacy as seriously as the rest of us did.\nWe cannot help but wonder if these trivialised responses reveal some deep flaw that we had never suspected before.\nCould we have been wrong about him?\nAnd if so, could we have been this wrong?\nFor reasons, all we heard at the time was, essentially, \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d There was some implication that he didn\u2019t feel up to international travel anymore, so couldn\u2019t make it to World Youth Day and similar events.\nThe trivialising of the resignation seemed to go hand in hand with the modern concept of the pope-as-pop-star, something we had thought Benedict was too serious a man, too serious a Catholic, to believe himself.\nOf all people, we had assumed that Benedict XVI took the papacy seriously.\nAnd since then, as all the poisons that had been lurking for fifty years in the NewChurch mud are busily hatching out, many Catholics want to know why we hear nothing from him?\nThis man whom we had believed a \u201cchampion of orthodoxy,\u201d whom we thought we knew.\nError, even heresy and blasphemy are pouring daily out of the mouth of his successor, who has, literally, turned the Vatican into a den of thieves, and we hear nothing but the occasional, carefully worded statement on how fine everything is.\nHow content he is with his decision and how happy with his current life.\nAfter three years of systematic dismantling of everything he had attempted to do in his pontificate, we got this from an apparently utterly insouciant Ratzinger, addressed to Francis: \u201cYour goodness is my home and the place where I feel safe.\u201d Everyone who had ever read anything he had written were amazed he was capable of producing such maudlin drivel, but the video doesn\u2019t lie:\nSo strange was this new tone that speculation started circulating that he was under some kind of external compulsion, not free to speak his mind.\nBut this is not what we see.\nThere he is, manifestly happy and reading it out loud.\n\u201cPerhaps it was written for him.\u201d Well, why repeat it then?\nWhy, if he has any qualms, allow himself to be trotted out on such occasions, to read this blatant propaganda?\nIf it is a deception, why participate in it?\nIn fact, all the hopeful commenters on blogs and other social media who keep telling me how much they \u201cmiss\u201d him have failed to respect him in one way; they won\u2019t take him at his word.\nSome insist that his resignation was under some sort of coercion and so isn\u2019t valid.\nBut we have repeatedly heard from him that he was under no constraint, that he had resigned freely.\nAnd indeed, far from being an isolated \u201cprisoner of the Vatican,\u201d Benedict has received many guests all of whom report that, though frail, he appears content and never utters a word of criticism.\nWe have yet to hear any report of any notes begging for rescue hidden under a lunch table placemat.\nThere\u2019s no doubt that this is an extremely strange and frankly fishy situation; something doesn\u2019t add up, it\u2019s true.\nAll the questions have gone ignored, or have received frivolous, jokey responses:\nWhy did you resign?\nRatzinger: \u201cI was a bit tired and didn\u2019t feel up to partying with the kids at World Youth Day.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re not pope, why do you still wear the white?\nRatzinger: \u201cOh, there wasn\u2019t a black cassock that fit me.\u201d\nWhy do you continue to call yourself Benedict XVI if you are no longer pope?\nRatzinger: \u201cWell, I\u2019m an \u2018emeritus,\u2019 you see\u2026\u201d\nAnd where did this \u201cemeritus\u201d business come from?\nDoes it have any precedent in Catholic history?\nWhat does it mean canonically and doctrinally?\nRatzinger: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nWhat was all that rubbish from Ganswein about there being a divided \u201cmunus\u201d \u2013 with an active member and a \u201ccontemplative member\u201d?\nDoesn\u2019t that just mean there are two popes now?\nRatzinger: \u201c\u2026\u201d\nAnd perhaps most agonising of all: \u201cHow can you just sit there smiling, issuing bland platitudinous nonsense, while this lunatic drives the sheep off a cliff?\u201d\nA few days ago, my friend Steve Skojec, of the traditionalist/restorationist website One Peter Five, summed up the consternation of those of us who still feel a lingering affection for (the man we used to call) Pope Benedict.\nSteve summons up in this brief post all the anger and all the crushing disappointment most of us probably still feel reluctant to express out loud:\nFive years ago today, Pope Benedict XVI abdicated the papacy.\nAnd through the abandonment of his duty to shepherd the Church, he made way for the worst papacy of all time \u2013 one he steadfastly refuses to oppose in word, deed, or even the subtlest gesture.\nYou may love him for various reasons, you may miss him by contrast, but you may not excuse the responsibility he has.\nHe walked away from his family, leaving the door open to an abusive stepfather, and he watches his children beaten and led astray not just in silence, but in apparent contentment.\nAnd still, he was the best of the post-conciliar popes, which is why he\u2019s the only one who won\u2019t be canonized.\nWho is the real Joseph Ratzinger?\nI have had long-time Vatican watchers say to me, more than once, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s really just that he wasn\u2019t who we thought he was.\u201d I suspect there is a lot more to this than most people might imagine.\nI think we made the mistake of believing the press.\nWe were delighted that the bitterly anti-Catholic media hated and feared him.\nWe failed to recall that they know nothing at all about Catholicism.\nWhat the papers never told us was that as a young priest and theologian Joseph Ratzinger was known as a \u201cprogressive,\u201d as the term was understood in 1962.\nThis reputation was cemented during his work as the peritus, the theological advisor, of one of the Council\u2019s most influential of the bishops of the progressive camp, Cardinal Josef Frings of Cologne.\nFrings\u2019 claim to fame in that great drama was a speech criticising the CDF \u2013 and its prefect Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani \u2013 for the \u201cconservatism\u201d in the \u201cschema,\u201d the documents prepared by the CDF for guiding the bishops\u2019 discussions.\nAfter this speech, there was an uprising among the bishops of the preparatory committee who demanded that the schema \u2013 that had taken years to develop \u2013 be abandoned.\nThis was done, over Ottaviani\u2019s futile objections, and new documents were rapidly cobbled together by a coalition of German and French \u201cprogressives\u201d who rejoiced that they had, in effect, seized control of the Council from that moment, before it had even started.\nIt has since been revealed that it was Joseph Ratzinger \u2013 the maverick \u201cprogressive\u201d academic theologian Frings had brought to Rome as his secretary \u2013 who wrote that speech.\nCardinal Henri de Lubac, writing in 1985, recalling that drama, said:\n\u201cJoseph Ratzinger, an expert at the Council, was also the private secretary of Card.\nFrings, Archbishop of Cologne.\nBlind, the old Cardinal largely utilized his secretary to write his interventions.\nNow then, one of these interventions became memorable: it was a radical criticism of the methods of the Holy Office.\nDespite a reply by Card.\nOttaviani, Frings sustained his critique.\n\u201cIt is not an exaggeration to say that on that day the old Holy Office, as it presented itself then, was destroyed by Ratzinger in union with his Archbishop.\n\u201cCard.\nSeper, a man full of goodness, intiated the renovation.\nRatzinger, who did not change, continues it.\u201d\nRatzinger\u2019s reputation as a \u201cprogressive\u201d is not based on one incident, nor was it restricted to his early work.\nIt went unnoticed in the shouting over his running of CDF, that he had written in 1982, a call for the Church \u201cnever to return\u201d to the Syllabus of Errors of Pius IX.\nIn his book Principles of Catholic Theology, Ratzinger proposed the question, \u201cShould the Council be revoked?\u201d and in response recommended the \u201crazing of the bastions\u201d of the Catholic Church in relation to the modern world:\nThe duty is, therefore, not to suppress the Council, but to discover the real Council and delve deep into what it truly wants with regard to what has happened since then.\nThis implies that there is no possible return to the Syllabus, which could well have been a first step in the combat against Liberalism and the nascent Marxism, but which cannot be the last word.\nNeither embraces nor the ghetto can resolve the problem of [relations with] the modern world for the Christian.\nHence, the 'razing of the bastions' that Hans Urs von Balthasar called for already in 1952 was in effect an urgent duty.\nIt was necessary for her [the Church] to raze the old bastions and confide only in the protection of the faith, the power of the word that is her unique, true, and permanent strength.\nBut to raze the bastions cannot signify that she no longer has anything to protect, or that she can live owing to different forces than those that engendered her: the water and the blood that poured from the open side of her crucified Lord.\nHis was the thesis \u2013 a mainstay of \u201cconservative\u201d ideology \u2013 that the \u201creal\u201d Council, if only implemented properly, would be the salvation of the Church and the world, a theme he never left.\nHow ironic it must have seemed to those who remembered this history that Ratzinger would himself be given the office he had \u201cdestroyed\u201d and would gain the media-generated reputation as an \u201carch-conservative\u201d.\nAnd it starts to suggest an answer, or at least a line of inquiry, about why so little was actually accomplished in his long tenure.\nWith the \u201carch-conservative\u201d \u201cRottweiler\u201d Ratzinger in CDF, why do we have the situation we have today?\nWhat did he do to stop the explosion of neo-modernism \u2013 that burned like an unchecked wildfire throughout the Catholic world through the reign of John Paul II?\nWhat did \u201csilencing\u201d by Ratzinger\u2019s CDF do to stop Hans Kung becoming a celebrity \u201cpriest-theologian,\u201d courted by the media for his loathing of Catholicism?\nKung, who was never removed from the priesthood despite his manifest heresy?\nCan we think of any other names who were corrected even to this degree?\nPrecious few.\nBut we can certainly think of many, many who spent their lives and vocations blatantly denying and undermining the Catholic Faith \u2013 academic theologians, religious, priests, bishops and cardinals around the world \u2013 with never a peep of protest from Rome.\nMoreover, the scandalous pack of frauds we currently have in the episcopate is entirely the product of the \u201carch-conservative\u201d John Paul II and the \u201cRottweiler\u201d Benedict XVI pontificates.\nWhy did we think that Ratzinger, in this crucial role of CDF prefect, was a bulwark of orthodoxy?\nIs it simply that we have moved so far away from the ancient Faith that we no longer have a realistic notion of the Faith ourselves to make a comparison, to make an objective judgement?\nThe \u201cprogressive\u201d destroyer of Ottaviani inheriting his office and the epithet \u201carch-conservative\u201d\u2026\nIndeed, Ratzinger himself maintained that he had never changed his theological opinions.\nHe was to say that it was his old academic colleagues like Kung and Kasper who had moved further to the ideological \u201cleft\u201d after the 1960s while he stayed in place.\nPerhaps now, as an answer that fits our apparently contradictory puzzle pieces, we can finally accept his word on this.\nPerhaps the world of Catholic academic theology had become so corrupted that a man called \u201cprogressive\u201d in 1963, but whose ideas remained the same, would look like a \u201cchampion of traditional Catholic orthodoxy\u201d by 2005.\nIs this why he resigned?\nIs it simply that his conception of the Church, of the papacy, was never what Catholics believed about it?\nPerhaps a hint at the answer comes from La Stampa in 2015 which published some of the memoirs of Silvano Fausti, SJ, who had been confessor and spiritual guide of Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, the godfather of the \u201cliberal\u201d European Catholic Church, and alleged leader of the \u201cSankt Gallen Mafia\u201d that Cardinal Danneels admitted conspired for years against Pope Benedict.\nFausti said that Benedict met with Martini at the bishops\u2019 palace of Milan in June 2012.\nMartini, Fausti said, urged Benedict to resign the papacy.\nApparently at the time of his election in 2005, Martini had said it would be his main task to reform the Curia.\nBy 2012, this had proved impossible.\nWhy would Benedict take advice from a man like Martini \u2013 the \u201cgodfather\u201d of the \u201cliberal wing\u201d of European Catholicism?\nI think the question would not even occur to a man like Ratzinger.\nThey were esteemed academic colleagues.\nThey were brothers of the episcopate.\nThey were members of the club.\nAny appearance of ideological division between them was, in essence, a product of the media narrative.\nWhy wouldn\u2019t the pope take the advice of his most respected and senior cardinal?\nWhy is Walter Kasper a cardinal?\nOne of the most prominent of those puzzle pieces is the apparent inability of these \u201cconservative\u201d prelates, to detect, let alone effectively oppose, these brazen enemies of the Faith within the episcopate and College of Cardinals.\nIt beggars belief of ordinary people that, after so many years of hearing and reading them, Ratzinger would remain on such friendly terms with men like Walter Kasper and Carlo Maria Martini, the alleged brains of the Sankt Gallen Mafia.\nWhen, at his very first Angelus address in 2013, Pope Francis told the crowd how much he loved the writing of Walter Kasper, quite a lot of us who had spent many years watching the Vatican started understanding where we were all headed with the new pope.\nJorge Bergoglio might have been unknown to the larger Catholic world, but Walter Kasper was a celebrity heretic, the media-savvy frontman for the \u201cultra-liberal\u201d \u201cwing\u201d of the post-Vatican II Church.\nIn an article on the cardinal\u2019s life\u2019s work, Thomas Jansen, the editor-in-chief of Katholisch.de, recently noted that Walter Kasper could not possibly have done the damage he has without the direct assistance of both John Paul II and Pope Benedict.\nThe monstrous debacle of Amoris Laetitia is as much Kasper\u2019s work as Bergoglio\u2019s.\nThis is a man who has, for 40 years, never troubled to hide his heterodox opinions and has devoted much of his life to a campaign to bring about precisely this outcome.\nJansen points out that Kasper had already tried to bring out the same proposal for Communion for divorced and remarried in 1993, together with Karl Lehmann, another \u201cSankt Gallen\u201d member.\nThis was stopped by Ratzinger and the CDF.\nBut that raises the next question; if Ratzinger knew so well what kind of creature Kasper was, why wasn\u2019t the next step to pitch him out of the episcopate on his ear?\nWhy was he not \u2013 at the very least \u2013 given the same \u201csilencing\u201d treatment as Kung?\nKasper has recently gone to the media again to complain of being called a heretic.\nBut it\u2019s a simple truth: he\u2019s a heretic.\nEveryone knows he\u2019s a heretic because we have heard him trumpeting in his blatant heresies from every rooftop he could find for decades.\nAfter openly working against the Faith, instead of being demoted, silenced, laicised and/or excommunicated, John Paul II made him a cardinal.\nRemember that his scheme to Amoris-Latitia-ize the Church was stopped by Ratzinger\u2019s CDF in 1993.\nBut he was not demoted, reprimanded or corrected in any way.\nNor was he removed from places of influence.\nFar from it.\nIn 1994 Kasper was inserted into the Vatican Curia by being named co-chair of the International Commission for Lutheran-Catholic Dialogue.\nIn 1999, he made another step up, being appointed secretary of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, the \u201cecumenical\u201d office where his manifest religious indifferentism could be given free reign.\nIn 2001, he was made a Cardinal-deacon with the awesome responsibility of voting in a Conclave.\nThen Benedict allowed him to remain a cardinal.\nAnd, as if to add a finishing touch to the poisoned cake that is Ratzinger\u2019s involvement in the creation of the New Catholic Paradigm, Benedict is now being said to have deliberately timed his resignation in order to allow his old academic colleague to participate in the 2013 Conclave.\nAs Jansen pointed out, and Maike Hickson quoted in a piece for One Peter Five,\nCardinal Kasper barely even made it into the last conclave, because he had just turned 80 years of age.\nBut since the date of the death (or abdication, as it was the case in 2013) of the pope is decisive, he was still able to attend and vote in that election.\n(As some observers noted, it was a generous gesture toward Cardinal Kasper that Pope Benedict XVI had decided to retire in due time.)\nExcuse me Maike, but I don\u2019t think this is a parenthetical issue.\nIs it any wonder that so many Catholics have become disaffected?\nCardinal Ratzinger, Pope \u201cEmeritus\u201d Benedict \u2013 whatever you want to call yourself \u2013 I have one question that I would really like you to answer: Why is this man still a cardinal?\nWhy is he still a bishop?\nWhy is he still allowed to call himself a \u201cCatholic theologian\u201d?\nWhy did you, apparently deliberately, ensure that he was able to enter the Conclave to decide who your successor was going to be?\nDoesn\u2019t anyone else want to know this?\nDon\u2019t we all want to know why Hans Kung is still a priest?\nWhy was Cardinal Mahony allowed to retire in good standing?\nWhy a man like Weakland, the active homosexual who paid off his ex-lover, was not excommunicated?\nWhat are the names we all remember, just off the top of our heads?\nMy own bishop in Victoria, the occultist Remi de Roo, Seattle\u2019s Raymond Hunthausen, Miami\u2019s Favalora, Rochester\u2019s Matthew Clark, Derek Worlock of Liverpool\u2026 I sometimes wonder how long that list is going to be when this is all over.\nFor fifty years Catholics have wanted to know why nothing was ever done, as these wolves in the episcopate were allowed, year after year to continue attacking the Church.\nWhy have we so often seen these men \u2013 compromised intellectually and morally \u2013 elevated to superior rank, despite the incredible brazenness of their hatred of the Catholic Faith?\nThe end of \u201cBig Umbrella Catholicism\u201d\nThe New York Times\u2019 Ross Douthat is among those who are starting to ask these kinds of questions.\nMaike Hickson quotes him, writing of this bizarre situation \u2013 in which each, of the so-called \u201cSankt Gallen Mafia\u201d prelates, including Kasper, who openly campaigned for the effective abolition of Catholic moral teaching: \u201cIt was characteristic of the church\u2019s effective truce [between conservatives and progressivists] that John Paul II himself had given most of them their red hats, elevating them despite their disagreement with his restorationist approach.\u201d\nWhen journalists talk about Catholicism, they often speak of a man like Kasper being \u2013 as his Wikipedia page puts it \u2013 \u201cone of the main figures of the liberal wing of the Catholic Church.\u201d And this is supposed to make some kind of sense to Catholics, we\u2019re supposed to accept it as the reality of our times.\nThere\u2019s a \u201cliberal wing\u201d and a \u201cconservative wing\u201d and they\u2019re both Catholic.\nSteve Skojec told me that our willingness to go along with the whole \u201cemeritus pope\u201d charade was an error: \u201cI think the problem is that we all went along with their game of make believe, and we shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d In fact, I am starting to think that the willingness of most Catholics to go along with the entire charade of post-conciliar Catholicism has been a grave error.\nBy playing along, by pretending that we could be \u201cconservative Catholics\u201d in this New Paradigm that also includes \u201cliberal Catholics\u201d we have helped them perpetrate one the most monstrous frauds in human history.\nBecause of this schizophrenic mindset of the Church\u2019s leadership since 1965, we have all come to accept the underlying premise; that the Church is a \u201cbig umbrella\u201d with plenty of room for people of all personal opinions, that such issues as liturgy are matters of personal \u201ctaste\u201d \u2026that two opposed things can both be Catholic truth.\nThis schizophrenia is the model under which \u201cconservatives\u201d have operated all this time, and by which they have judged a man like Joseph Ratzinger to be a \u201cconservative champion of orthodoxy.\u201d And what has this achieved?\nIt created cover for the men of Kasper\u2019s clique to maneuver their man on the throne of Peter five years ago.\nAnd just like that, the jargon of \u201ctolerance\u201d and the \u201cbig umbrella\u201d is over and the purge of faithful, believing Catholic religious, seminarians, priests, and academics has begun.\nAs it had to.\nThey, at least, do not harbour this insane contradiction, and understand \u2013 and frequently say out loud \u2013 that the New Paradigm and the Catholic Church are not the same.\nAnd their New Church is the only one left.\nFor five decades we played the Anglican game; as long as we don\u2019t talk about it, there isn\u2019t a problem.\nOttaviani\u2019s Holy Office and schema were the last gasp of the old Church \u2013 and as de Lubac said above, it was killed by Joseph Ratzinger.\nWe had a long hiatus in which the popes pretended nothing essential had changed, while the institution around them fell to the New Paradigm, until the papacy was the only thing left.\nOne of the things I\u2019ve been saying is a blessing in disguise, and an enormous relief, about the Bergoglian era is that we can finally leave behind us the absurd situation of the Wojtyla/Ratzinger era.\nWe were expected for all those years to pretend we were in the \u201cNew Springtime of Vatican II,\u201d while we watched these wolves in shepherds\u2019 clothing eating the sheep.\nNow we can, at least, finally stop pretending that everything is just dandy under the New Paradigm of Merciful Conciliar Wonderfulness.\nFor those still wondering, Bergoglio isn\u2019t a shock, he isn\u2019t even a surprise; he\u2019s just the logical end result.\nThis pontificate isn\u2019t an anomaly; it was the only possible outcome, and it was as much the work of Joseph Ratzinger as Walter Kasper.\n", ["Repetition", "Thought-terminating_Cliches", "Doubt",

from Kazi reading, \u201cI did this for Allah and Islam.\nAllahu akbar.\u201d\nOf course, even if they had found those things, given the FBI\u2019s recent track record of denial and deception, they may still be searching for Kazi\u2019s motive.\nIn any case, a larger point is being lost here.\nAnd that is that there is a war going on.\nWe know that the Islamic State, al-Qaeda and other groups have called upon Muslims in the U.S. to try to kill military personnel and police, as well as civilians.\nWe know that Kazi, with all the propane and gas tanks in his car, was clearly trying to set off a major fire that would kill more people than just himself.\nEven if he wasn\u2019t on the phone to Baghdadi, the likelihood is that when a Muslim drives into a U.S. Air Force Base with a car full of incendiaries, probably this has something to do with the global jihad.\nThe FBI\u2019s bafflement here is part of its deep, deep corruption.\nThe FBI doesn\u2019t acknowledge that there is a global jihad, or that Islam has anything to do with terrorism.\nIt doesn\u2019t admit that there is a war going on, and treats each act of Islamic terror as if it were a separate and discrete criminal event,

war aims.\nAuthorities are also investigating whether or not Kazi was suffering from any mental health issues.\nHere again, this is just more of the general refusal to acknowledge the 800-pound gorilla sitting in the living room and screaming \u201cAllahu akbar.\u201d Sean Ragan might explain to us that authorities are also trying to determine whether the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 was motivated by Nazism, or by mental health issues among the German High Command.\nThis willful ignorance leads to a diversion and waste of resources that is astronomical and catastrophic.\nHow long is this comic opera going to continue?\nIf the jihadis advance even into the FBI\u2019s Sacramento offices, will agents there be struggling to determine the jihadis\u2019

accused the family of green.\n\u201cFor the sake of money they would have done anything,\u201d Gilani\u2019s cousin, Syed Ahmed, told the Daily Mail.\n\u201cThere are possibilities that [Imran] or them might have been selling [House] information,\u201d he added.\n(Syed Ahmed knew Abid well enough to loan him money, according to bankruptcy documents filed by Abid.)\nThe FBI arrested Imran, the eldest of the three Awan brothers, at Dulles Airport trying to fly to Pakistan in July, and prosecutors charged him with fraudulently gathering money the prior winter to wire overseas, possibly in an attempt to flee the investigation into the family\u2019s activities involving House computers.\n\u201cBased on the suspicious timing of that transaction, Awan and [wife Hina] Alvi likely knew they were under investigation at that time\u201d and \u201cthere are strong indications of flight in this case,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\nAbid was making his own efforts to round up money at the same time via the life insurance policy.\nOn Nov. 16, 2016, the brothers made a video of his bedridden father signing over ownership \u2014 but not changing the beneficiary \u2014 of his life insurance policy to Abid.\nAbid then used those rights to replace Gilani with himself as beneficiary.\nWhen his father died on Jan. 16, 2017, the youngest Awan brother, Jamal, attested on the death certificate provided to the insurance company that his father was divorced, a statement Gilani\u2019s lawyer said would have kept her from the money.\nA Virginia court later ruled that Jamal\u2019s statement about his marital status on the certificate was wrong.\n\u201cWhy is that even relevant?\u201d Bacon said of Jamal\u2019s misstatement at the March 7 court date.\nOn Dec. 12, 2016, Imran and Alvi \u2013 who was also on the House payroll \u2013 began taking a series of withdrawals from banks, some of which federal prosecutors say occurred under fraudulent pretenses.\nIn January 2017, Imran wired nearly $300,000 to Pakistan.\nImran wired nearly $300,000 to Pakistan Jan. 18, according to the indictment.\nOn Jan. 17, Abid filed notarized papers using those rights to replace Gilani with himself as beneficiary.\nThe life insurance change\u2019s timing seems to coincide with other moves by Abid to liquidate property and transfer it.\nTen weeks prior, on Nov. 1, 2016, Alvi sold a house to Jamal for $620,000, netting another significant profit from the mortgage company.\nIn addition to his primary residence, Abid owned the house where his mother and stepfather lived, and moved in after his death, with Gilani becoming homeless.\nAbid owned two homes despite a $1 million 2012 bankruptcy that might ordinarily have forced him to sell the second home to pay creditors.\nAt that time, he filed forms \u201cunder penalty of perjury\u201d that two houses were needed as \u201cmy spouse and I are legally separated under applicable non-bankruptcy law or my spouse and I are living apart other than for the purposes of evading the requirements.\u201d\nHowever, his wife, Ukrainian-born Nataliia Sova \u2013 who also was on the House payroll \u2013 signed as a witness on the 2016 life insurance form as \u201cspouse of Abid,\u201d and they have been photographed living together.\nGilani told TheDCNF the brothers were trying to use the life insurance policy as leverage to persuade her to sign a power of attorney giving them access to \u201cassets of my late husband in Pakistan,\u201d which were much more valuable than the $50,000 policy.\nAmerico, the life insurance company, said there was \u201cgreat doubt\u201d about who the rightful policy holder was, given the allegations of fraud, and sent the decision to the courts to sort out on April 14, two months after the House sargent-at-arms banned the Awans for \u201csuspicious activity.\u201d\nGilani alleged the brothers took her financial documents, a laptop, and her husband\u2019s possessions.\nThe only lawyer she could afford, she claimed, was Michael Hadeed, a business attorney who was convicted in 2010 of conspiracy and immigration fraud for helping aliens obtain green cards by setting them up with fake employment relationships.\nHe lost his bar license for two years, according to Virginia State Bar documents.\nHadeed did not introduce any evidence to the judge about a pattern of possible fraud by Abid, the timing of the move as it relates to the federal criminal case, or the mental capacity of the dying man to understand paperwork.\nHadeed withdrew earlier allegations of fraud and asked the judge to try the case based solely on interpretation of contract language.\nAfter court, Hadeed told reporters Bacon had threatened to sue him for defamation.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to subject myself to that,\u201d he said outside court.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get myself in a lawsuit over this.\u201d\nIn court, Bacon badgered Hadeed.\n\u201cAre you going to share any more info with them?\nI hope not.\nI hope you learned that lesson,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou have no control over [Gilani], do you?\nYou\u2019re like, talking to a wall,\u201d he said of Gilani.\nHadeed said three different signatures from Abid on financial documents did not match, and put a defiant Abid on the witness stand.\nHadeed: Why do your signatures look different?\nAbid: My signatures are not very consistent, I\u2019m just a human being\u2026\nHadeed: You were aware you were changing beneficiary from your father\u2019s spouse to yourself?\nAbid: That was my father\u2019s request\u2026\nHadeed: You\u2019re not answering the question.\nAbid: I\u2019m not very smart, so it takes a while sometimes\u2026\nJudge: I don\u2019t understand why the witness is having such trouble with the question.\nYour job is to answer the question.\nIn court documents, Gilani alleged, \u201cwhile he was admitted in hospital my telephone conversations were taped and some other recording devices were also installed/planted in my house \u2026 Imran Awan showed up and threatened me for me calling the police.\n[Imran] threatened that he is very powerful and if I ever call the police again [he] will do harm to me.\u201d She said that Imran eventually agreed to remove the listening devices and did so in front of her.\nBased on Hadeed\u2019s narrow legal argument about the life insurance contract\u2019s language, the judge ruled that, \u201cThe son as the owner of the policy has the absolute right to change the beneficiary.\u201d\nAfter Gilani retained a lawyer, Bacon had offered a settlement where they\u2019d split the money, but Gilani declined it.\nThe court awarded Abid the $50,000 life insurance payout, minus $5,000 that the insurance company took for its expenses in litigating the fraud allegations.\n\u201cYou should have taken the settlement.\nNow she\u2019s not getting a penny,\u201d Bacon said in court.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not getting anything.\u201d\nGilani said after court that her conscience didn\u2019t allow her to settle.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do the deal because they had been adopting bad behaviors.\nI cannot agree to

ties to senior White House national security officials, including \u2013 who else \u2013 National Security Adviser John Bolton, seeks to reshape longstanding American foreign policy toward Iran by emphasizing an explicit policy of regime change, something the Obama administration opposed when popular protests gripped Iran in 2009, writes the Free Beacon, which obtained a leaked copy of the circulating plans.\nThe regime change plan seeks to fundamentally shift U.S. policy towards Iran and has found a receptive audience in the Trump administration, which has been moving in this direction since Bolton\u2014a longtime and vocal supporter of regime change\u2014entered the White House.\nIt deemphasizes U.S military intervention, instead focusing on a series of moves to embolden an Iranian

plan to overthrow Iran has long been in the works.\nIn fact, in April 2012, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, Seymour Hersh reported that the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command had trained (Mojahedin-e Khalq) MEK operatives at a secret site in Nevada from 2005 to 2009 for this very purpose.\nMEK is the Iranian political-militant organization that advocates for the violent overthrow of the current Iranian regime.\nThey are hardly quiet about it.\nCoincidentally, MEK was classified as a terrorist organization by the United States and its allies\u2014during this training period\u2014until none other than Hillary Clinton suddenly removed them from the list in 2012.\nAccording to Hersh, MEK members were trained in intercepting communications, cryptography, weaponry and small unit tactics at the Nevada site until President Barack Obama took office in 2009.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom

in Iran in January which snowballed into the situation today.\nHersh also reported additional names of former U.S. officials paid to speak in support of MEK, including former CIA directors James Woolsey and Porter Goss; New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani; former Vermont Governor Howard Dean; former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation Louis Freeh and former U.N.\nAmbassador John Bolton.\nFor over a decade, Bolton has been calling for regime change in Iran.\nNow, he\u2019s the National Security Advisor.\nIt just so happens that at least one of these calls for regime change in Iran was caught on video last year as Bolton gave a speech at the Grand Gathering of Iranians for Free Iran.\n\u201cThere is a viable opposition to the rule of the ayatollahs, and that opposition is centered in this room today.\nI had said for over 10 years since coming to these events, that the declared policy of the United States of America should be the overthrow of the mullahs\u2019 regime in Tehran.\nThe behavior and the objectives of the regime are not going to change, and therefore the only solution is to change the regime itself.\nAnd that\u2019s why, before 2019, we here will celebrate in Tehran!\u201d\nPay attention to the first line in that quote above in which Bolton notes that the opposition needed to overthrow Iran\u2019s current regime \u201cis centered in this room today.\u201d Who was in that room?\nWell, the entire event was actually put on by the People\u2019s Mojahedin Organization of Iran, also known as the Mojahedin-e Khalq or MEK.\nAs Politico pointed out in a 2016 article, despite the neocon attempts to rewrite history, MEK have killed Americans and committed multiple acts of terrorism.\nFor decades, and based on U.S. intelligence, the United States government has blamed the MEK for killing three U.S. Army colonels and three U.S. contractors, bombing the facilities of numerous U.S. companies and killing innocent Iranians.\nTo recap, the formerly terrorist-classified organization MEK, trained in the US and granted special privilege status by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2012\u2014which has since been heavily funded to refine their image by having famous US neoconservative war hawks from both sides of the isle actually chant for \u201cregime change\u201d on their behalf\u2014is now the darling child of the neocon agenda and the impetus behind what could kick of World War 3.\nWhile the current Iranian regime is certainly no bastion of freedom, the idea that US intervention or a violent revolution would be beneficial for the people of Iran or American citizens is outright insane.\nTo see what US intervention\u2014through military support and the support of opposition groups\u2014does to countries, one need only look at Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya to see the horrific death tolls and war-ravaged dystopias left in America\u2019s wake.\nTo those paying attention over the years, Trump\u2019s desire to intervene in Iran, and his subsequent support in the media and from all sides of the political spectrum should come as no surprise as it has been the plan since Bill Clinton was in office and was documented in the neoconservative PNAC report.\nThis was even admitted by General Wesley Clark, former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, that the U.S. planned on going to war with Iran, according to a 2001 memo from the U.S. Secretary of Defense.\n\u201cThis is a memo that describes how we\u2019re going to take out seven countries in five years,\u201d Clark said.\n\u201cStarting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and finishing off with Iran.\u201d\nAll presidents since Clinton have crossed countries off this list.\nNow it\u2019s Trump\u2019s turn.\nArticle posted with

landmark nuclear deal and reimposition of harsh economic sanctions that could topple a regime already beset by protests and a crashing economy, according to a copy of the plan obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.\nThe three-page white paper being circulated among National Security Council officials in the White House offers a strategy by which the Trump administration can actively work to assist an already aggravated Iranian public topple the hardline ruling regime through a democratization strategy that focuses on driving a deeper wedge between the Iranian people and the ruling regime.\nThe plan, authored by the Security Studies Group, or SSG, a national security think-tank that has close ties to senior White House national security officials, including National Security Adviser John Bolton, seeks to reshape longstanding American foreign policy toward Iran by emphasizing an explicit policy of regime change, something the Obama administration opposed when popular

this direction since Bolton\u2014a longtime and vocal supporter of regime change\u2014entered the White House.\nAh, yes, John Bolton.\nWhile I applaud Bolton for his willingness to call Islamic jihadis just that, I am not so naive as to consider that his membership in the Council on Foreign Relations has no effect in this decision.\n\"The ordinary people of Iran are suffering under economic stagnation, while the regime ships its wealth abroad to fight its expansionist wars and to pad the bank accounts of the Mullahs and the IRGC command,\" SSG writes in the paper.\n\"This has provoked noteworthy protests across the country in recent months.\"\nWell, why is that?\nIt's due to sanctions imposed by the likes of the US.\nAs has been pointed out before, sanctions hurt the people, not the governments that lead them and then those same governments use the effects to propagandize the people against those who are ordering the sanctions.\nI'm not saying the Iranian government is good, but it is Iran's government.\nHonestly, I see a ton of corruption and warmongering in our own government that rivals some of that of governments that America stands against.\nStill, as was pointed out by Matt Agorist, Bolton told an audience of the Grand Gathering of Iranians for Free Iran:\n\u201cThere is a viable opposition to the rule of the ayatollahs, and that opposition is centered in this room today.\nI had said for over 10 years since coming to these events, that the declared policy of the United States of America should be the overthrow of the mullahs\u2019 regime in Tehran.\nThe

that \u201cnothing\u2019s off the table right now if Israel is attacked.\u201d\nOK, I get they may pose a danger, but let's look at the reality here.\nThose they pose a danger to, namely Saudi Arabia and Israel can both fend perfectly well for themselves and have demonstrated that ability to do it.\nThere is no need for the US to be involved in it in any way.\nWhy should we be fighting a battle or encouraging, funding, and I'm quite sure arming, a rebellion?\nWhere is that authorized in our Constitution?\nSimple.\nIt isn't.\nI care little for the Saudi government as they help push Sharia and is the land where many of the 9-11 hijackers came from.\nThe Iranian government I care for even less, but out of each of those, which one should America have dealt with militarily following 9-11?\nBoth, if you're going to go by information that we have a record on.\nWhy can't America focus on it's own issues and solve those?\nIt's because we are too busy trying to police the world, keeping the spotlight off of those in our government who are attacking our rights and spending us into more and more debt.\nAnd lest you think this is about the nuclear deal.\nIt isn't.\n\u201cThe problem is not the Iran nuclear deal it\u2019s the Iranian regime,\u201d the source told the Beacon.\n\u201cTeam Bolton has spent years creating Plans B, C, and D for dealing with that problem.\nPresident Trump

honest readers who have followed me for some time know that's not the case.\nNotice some things that are taking place in Iran that the plan speaks about.\n\u201cMore than one third of Iran\u2019s

independence.\nRemember the Kurds?\nHow about the people in the Catalan region of Spain?\nNo support for those people, and why?\nCause it's not part of the agenda.\nI say if the Iranian people want their freedom, let them first free themselves from the bondage of Islam, and then let the passion that burns inside men to be free rise up as it did in our forefathers due to the teachings fo the Holy Scriptures and stand and fight.\nThen, they will be in a position to ask for aid, but only then.\n", ["Repetition", "Flag-Waving", "Appeal_to_fear-prejudice", "Black-and-White_Fallacy",

Hedge\nExperts fear an \u201cexplosive increase\u201d in Ebola cases after an outbreak in Congo entered a \u201cnew phase\u201d and spread from the countryside to a city.\nThe BBC reports that Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga confirmed a case in Mbandaka, a city of a million people about 130km (80 miles) from the area where the first cases were confirmed earlier this month.\nThe city is a major transportation hub with routes to the capital Kinshasa.\nForty-four people have been infected and 23 people are known to have died.\nSenior World Health Organization (WHO) official Peter Salama said the spread to Mbandaka meant there was the potential for an \u201cexplosive increase\u201d in cases.\n\u201cThis is a major development in the outbreak,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\u201cWe have urban Ebola, which is a very different animal from rural Ebola.\nThe potential for an explosive increase in cases is now there.\u201d Mr Salama, the WHO\u2019s deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response, said Mbandaka\u2019s location on the Congo river, widely used for transportation, raised the prospect of Ebola spreading to surrounding countries such as Congo-Brazzaville and the Central African Republic as well as downstream to Kinshasa, a city of 10 million people.\n\u201cThis puts a whole different lens on this outbreak and gives us increased urgency to move very quickly into Mbandaka to stop this new first sign of transmission,\u201d he said.\nThe BBC adds that the WHO said it was not recommending any trade or travel restrictions either within DR Congo, for example between Mbandaka and Kinshasa, or internationally.\nBut Mr Salama said that 13 countries in the region were boosting border screening measures and said DR Congo itself was increasing exit screening measures.\n\u201cThe good news is that the DR Congo population is very used to Ebola outbreaks,\u201d he added.\n\u201cThey know to protect themselves by avoiding mass gatherings and mass funerals.\nThey know as well that traditional healers can amplify the outbreak.\u201d\nAs The Daily Mail notes, it is the ninth time Ebola has been recorded in Congo since the disease made its first known appearance near its northern Ebola river in the 1970s.\nEbola is most feared for the internal and external bleeding it can cause in victims owing to damage done to blood vessels.\nThe Mail reports that health workers have recorded confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola in three health zones of Congo\u2019s Equateur province, and have identified 432 people who may have had contact with the disease, the WHO said.\nSupplies sent to Congo included more than 300 body bags for safe burials in affected communities.\nThe vaccine will be reserved for people suspected of coming into contact with the disease, as well as health workers.\nThe vaccine requires storage at a temperature between -60 and -80 degrees C, tricky in a country with unreliable electricity.\n",

Children To Write Out Their Submission To Allah,\u201d by Joshua Gill, Daily Caller News Foundation, May 17, 2018 (thanks to the Geller Report):\nA West Virginia school has come under fire for instructing junior high students to write the Islamic profession of faith ostensibly to practice calligraphy.\nRich Penkoski, a Christian parent and founder of online ministry Warriors for Christ, raised alarms over a packet on Islam his daughter\u2019s seventh grade social studies teacher issued to students, according to Christian Post.\nThe packet, edited from the full version of a world religions workbook, instructed students to practice writing the Shahada, or Islamic profession of faith, in Arabic calligraphy \u2014 an assignment that, if left undone, would result in detention, according to Penkoski\u2019s daughter.\nThe Shahada states: \u201cThere is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah.\u201d Penkoski called Mountain Ridge Middle School Principal Ron Branch and objected to the packet, saying it disturbed him and had misinformation about the history of calligraphy.\n\u201cI saw the assignment of writing the Shahada in Arabic.\nTheir excuse was calligraphy,\u201d Penkoski told The Christian Post.\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Whoa!\nWhoa!\nWhoa!\u2019 First of all, calligraphy was invented in China 3,000 years prior to Muhammad.\nThe fact that they were trying to get my daughter to write that disturbed me.\u201d \u201cI said, \u2018That is not happening.\nMy daughter is not doing that.\u2019 My daughter told me that if she didn\u2019t do the assignment, then she was going to get a [detention] slip,\u201d Penkoski added\u2026.\nThere were two different calligraphy assignments \u2014 one involving the Shahada and another instructing students to practice writing English letters in calligraphy, Branch told Christian Post.\nHinson \u201ctold the students that they could do these activities if they wanted,\u201d Branch claimed.\n\u201cThe teacher has told her class several times that this is a study of world religions and that she is not trying to advocate for any religion over another.\nShe has told her class that if they had questions about religious beliefs, that those conversations should take place with their parents,\u201d Branch added.\nPenkoski claimed the teacher sent students home with the same packet the day after he lodged a complaint \u2014 this time, with certain sections crossed out but still including the Shahada assignment.\nPenkoksi called the principal again and confronted Hinson over the phone.\n\u201cI said, \u2018This is not OK in asking my kid to write down the Shahada.\u2019 The teacher happened to walk-in and said she made it an option and that the kids didn\u2019t have to do it.\nMy daughter conflicted that story and said, \u2018No, that is not what was said.\u2019 What was said was, \u2018Do the assignment; and if you want to learn more about the Quran, ask your parents,\u2019\u201d Penkoski told Christian Post.\nEach religion studied in the class, including Christianity and Judaism, received \u201cequitable treatment,\u201d Branch also told Christian Post.\nHe said the class spent a week and a half on Christianity and Judaism \u2014 other religions took one week \u2014 and discussed each religion\u2019s beliefs, history and practices.\nDuring the section on Christianity, \u201cJesus was taught,\u201d Branch claimed.\n\u201cThe students read the chapter in our textbook that discusses Christianity\u2019s belief that Jesus is the Son of God, and salvation.\nThey also discussed the Sermon on the Mount, the Last Supper and Jesus\u2019 Betrayal, the Trinity, and the Lord\u2019s Prayer, among other topics,\u201d Branch said.\nPenkoski and his daughter, Brielle, contested Branch\u2019s claims.\nThe Lord\u2019s Prayer was not taught, and very little time was spent teaching about Jesus, they told Christian Post.\n\u201cWe did [the unit on Christianity] over a week and two days.\nWe watched two different videos.\nWe didn\u2019t finish them.\nThey taught a little bit about Moses and the Ten Commandments, Peter and Paul,\u201d Brielle explained.\n\u201cWe learned about the Israelites and how they are being persecuted by the Romans.\nWe were told about the Jews and told a little bit about Jesus.\u201d Penkoski also shared with Christian Post the packets on Christianity and Judaism passed out in class and allegedly modified from the original full version.\nWhile the packet on Islam contained verses from the Koran, the packets for those religions did not contain scripture and did not encourage students to write prayers or faith statements, he said.\n\u201cNotice no Bible verses, no reciting the Ten Commandments or the Lord\u2019s Prayer,\u201d he said.\n\u201c[There\u2019s] no practicing writing in Hebrew as compared to the Islamic packet,\u201d he added\u2026.\nArticle posted with permission from Robert

a welcoming environment in American public schools that are indefatigably committed to multiculturalism.\nWith the imperative to be \u201ctolerant\u201d robbing many educators of their ability to evaluate non-Western cultures critically, all too many public schools and individual teachers have proven to be susceptible to an organized campaign by U.S.-based Islamic organizations and their primary benefactor, Saudi Arabia, to present a view of Islam that whitewashes its violent history and intolerant doctrines.\nMany of the Islamic groups that vet American public school textbooks for the accuracy of their material on Islamic doctrine and history are Saudi-funded.\nThey make sure that the Islamic instruction in these textbooks presents a picture of Islam that is so pristine and whitewashed that it sometimes crosses the boundary from mere pro-Muslim bias into outright Islamic proselytizing.\nThe taboo about teaching religion in the public schools, so zealously established and guarded against Christian prayer by the ACLU and the Supreme Court over the last few decades, is increasingly set aside in American public schools, as presentations on Islam frequently cross the line between teaching facts about the religion and teaching the religion as fact.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you

Christianity and Judaism were given \u201cequitable treatment\u201d in the same class.\nPenkoski\u2019s daughter, Brielle, however, said that the class spent much less time on Christianity and Judaism than it did on Islam.\nPenkoski pointed out that the accompanying exercises were also less extensive for Christianity and Judaism than they were for Islam: \u201cNotice no Bible verses, no reciting the Ten Commandments or the Lord\u2019s Prayer.\n[There\u2019s] no practicing writing in Hebrew as compared to the Islamic packet.\u201d\nThis stealth proselytizing is nationwide.\nLast January, parents filed a federal complaint against Chatham Middle School in Chatham, New Jersey, for forcing students to watch videos that proselytized for Islam.\nOne video, according to the complaint, describes \u201cChristians and Jews as \u2018infidels\u2019 and prais[es] Muhammad in gruesome detail for slaughtering them.\u201d Parent Libby Hilsenrath characterized the accompanying assignment as \u201creplete with biased, chastising statements encouraging the students\u2026to follow the Quran and become Muslim.\u201d Another video, according to Hilsenrath, depicts a Muslim boy teaching his non-Muslim friend about Islam, after which both go to \u201clearn how to pray.\u201d\nThe complaint adds: \u201cDue to the fact that these doctrinal messages calling for conversion to Islam were included in video format with vivid images and text, they possess greater communicative impact and are more likely to be accepted by the students viewing them than information that is spoken in a classroom or even written in a book.\u201d\nThese accounts are not singular.\nHigh school students in Newton, Massachusetts in October 2017, according to Fox News, \u201cpretended to be Muslims in the \u2018Islamic\u2019 city of Jerusalem as part of a class assignment.\u201d The assignment also included a pro-Palestinian, anti-Israel article.\nJudicial Watch Senior Investigator Bill Marshall remarked: \u201cCitizens of Newton have been waging a minor war with school officials for years now, trying to get them to use balanced curriculum in their teaching materials on the subject of Islam and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\u201d Dr. Bill Saxton, chairman of Citizens for National Security, said that the assignment was a \u201cpurposeful attempt to indoctrinate our impressionable high-schoolers with the \u2018virtues\u2019 of Islam at the expense of Christianity, Judaism and other religions.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Georgia parent Michelle King noted in 2016: \u201cMy daughter had to learn the Shahid and the Five Pillars of Islam, which is what you learn to convert,\u201d while not teaching Christianity or the Ten Commandments.\nOne homework assignment in Walton County, Georgia, stated: \u201cAllah is the [blank] worshiped by Jews & Christians,\u201d with students having to fill in the blank with \u201csame God.\u201d\nParent Steve Alsup added: \u201cIt seemed like half the truth to me, they didn\u2019t talk about the extreme Islamics.\u201d Kim Embry, a spokesperson for Walton County Public Schools, said revealingly: \u201cWe are teaching the same stuff that everyone else is teaching.\u201d\nIndeed.\nIn 2015, students at Spring Hill Middle School in Spring Hill, Tennessee were forced as part of an assignment to write, \u201cThere is no god but Allah; Muhammad is his prophet.\u201d Mother Joy Ellis remarked: \u201cThis is a seventh grade state standard, and will be on the TCAP.\nI didn\u2019t have a problem with the history of Islam being taught, but to go so far as to make my child write the Shahada, is unacceptable.\u201d Another mother, Brandee Porterfield, observed: \u201cIt really did bother me that they skipped the whole chapter on the rise of Christianity and they spent three weeks just studying Islam\u2026.I spoke with the teacher and the principal,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThey are not going to learn any other religion, doctrines or creeds and they are not going back over this chapter.\nEven though they discuss Christianity a little bit during the Middle Ages, they are not ever going to have this basis for Judaism or Christianity later.\u201d\nMaury County Director of Schools, Chris Marczak, defended the curriculum: \u201cIt is our job as a public school system to educate our students on world history in order to be ready to compete in a global society, not to endorse one religion over another or indoctrinate.\u201d Porterfield, however, shot back: \u201cThey are not going over anything else.\nSo for the students to have to memorize this prayer, it does seem like it is indoctrination.\u201d\nNone of the encroachments of Islam in public schools should come as any real surprise.\nMulticulturalism, after all, amounts to respect for every culture except one\u2019s own.\nThe embarrassment, regret, and even self-hatred that has been inculcated in American public school students for decades now has created a vacuum, which Muslims have shown themselves to be all too eager to fill.\nCertainly, those who are furthering the Islamization of the schools would deny that they would like to see Islamic law implemented in the United States, and would indignantly reject the claim that their efforts were furthering that end in any way.\nThey would say that they are doing it all for tolerance, pluralism, and

Bangkok Post: news\nAn American flag is flown next to the Chinese national emblem during a welcome ceremony for visiting US President Donald Trump outside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Nov 9, 2017.\n(AP file photo)\nBEIJING: The US embassy in China issued a health alert Wednesday after a US government employee experienced an \"abnormal\" sound and suffered a mild brain injury -- in an incident reminiscent of a mysterious illness that hit diplomats in Cuba.\nUS and Chinese authorities are investigating the matter after the employee, who was assigned to the southern city of Guangzhou, was diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), said embassy spokeswoman Jinnie Lee.\nIn an alert emailed to US citizens in China, the embassy said it does not know what caused the symptoms or of any similar situations in the country.\nIn Cuba last year, the US disclosed that 24 diplomats and their family members had fallen victim to an unsolved mysterious attack that left them with injuries resembling brain trauma.\nTen Canadian diplomats and their relatives also suffered a strange illness.\n\"We cannot at this time connect it with what happened in Havana but we are investigating all possibilities,\" a US embassy official in Beijing told AFP on the condition of anonymity.\nThe embassy's health alert says the government employee \"recently reported subtle and vague, but abnormal, sensations of sound and pressure\".\n\"The US government is taking these reports seriously and has informed its official staff in China of this event,\" the message says.\nUS and Chinese authorities are investigating the matter, an embassy spokeswoman said\n\"While in China, if you experience any unusual acute auditory or sensory phenomena accompanied by unusual sounds or piercing noises, do not attempt to locate their source.\nInstead, move to a location where the sounds are not present,\" it says, urging people with medical problems to consult a doctor.\nLee said the employee experienced \"a variety of physical symptoms\" between late 2017 through April 2018.\nThe person was sent to the United States and diagnosed with MTBI on May 18.\n\"The (State) Department is taking this incident very seriously and is working to determine the cause and impact of the incident,\" Lee said.\n\"The Chinese government has assured us they are also investigating and taking appropriate measures.\"\nThe Chinese foreign ministry could not be immediately reached for comment.\n- Cuban case -\nIn Cuba, the American victims had associated the onset of their symptoms with \"unusual sounds or auditory sensations\", a State Department physician told the US Senate in January.\nCharles Rosenfarb, a doctor and director of the State Department bureau of medical services, said the symptoms were mixed but consistent with brain trauma.\nThe victims suffered headaches, hearing loss, disorientation and some loss of cognitive ability.\n(Video YouTube/TIME)\nInitially officials suspected the Americans had been targeted by some sort of acoustic weapon, although in public senior officials were more cautious, speaking of \"health attacks\".\nMedia reports have suggested that the FBI has not been able to verify any evidence to support the sonic weapon theory.\nThe US government has held Cuba responsible, arguing that Raul Castro's authoritarian state must have either carried out the assaults or at least known who was behind them.\nThe incident prompted the United States last year to withdraw more than half of its personnel at the embassy in Havana, which reopened in 2015 as the two nations re-established diplomatic relations that had ruptured in 1961.\nCanada announced last month that it was bringing home the families of its diplomats in Cuba after a year-long investigation into the illness failed to reveal a cause.\n\"The cause (of their symptoms) remains unknown but could be human-made,\" the Canadian government concluded.\nCanadian and US authorities had initially suspected a \"sonic attack\" or a \"mass psychosomatic incident\", but those are \"now considered unlikely\", a senior Canadian official said.\nThe symptoms included dizziness, headaches and a lack of ability to concentrate.\nUnlike their American counterparts, however, no Canadian envoy reported hearing any suspicious sound prior to falling ill.\n", []], ["Pope Francis vs Contemplative Orders\nThe Francis Vatican\u2019s approach to the contemplative life is probably the most illustrative of our entire crisis.\nContemplative life is aimed only at a purely supernatural end.\nIt has no \u201cuse\u201d in the sense that either the Bergoglians \u2013 in terms of their political machinations \u2013 or the world can understand.\nThere is probably no other place where the differences between the two programmes - the Catholic programme of Christ and the Bergoglian/Kasperian programme - are more sharply contrasted.\nOne aspect of Pope Francis\u2019 character that seems little-explored by the Catholic and secular media alike is his apparent disdain for contemplative religious life \u2013 a facet of Catholic life that could be described as the most purely religious of all the Church\u2019s undertakings.\nThe world does not understand it or want it.\nTherefore, it is something of a thorn in the Bergoglian side, and he has repeatedly expressed his contempt for it.\nSo when, in 2016 he issued a document on contemplative nuns, the faithful braced for impact .\nIn his recent document, ostensibly on holiness, \u201cGaudete et Exultate,\u201d the pope attacked the religious desire for silence and solitude, to be alone with God in prayer, seeking unity with Him, saying in essence that the Christian life is inherently about social activism, about material, worldly ends.\nTo these foundations of the contemplative life \u2013 indeed of any form of religious life in the Church \u2013 Francis set up another of his false dichotomies, contemplation in opposition to serving others, giving a Jesuit maxim as an imperative for all Catholics: \u201cWe are called to be contemplatives even in the midst of action, and to grow in holiness by responsibly and generously carrying out our proper mission.\u201d\nItalian Vaticanist Marco Tosatti commented dryly, \u201cRejoice and be glad\u2026 but not if you\u2019re a cloistered contemplative.\u201d\nIn 2016, I wrote that Francis\u2019 Apostolic Constitution, \u201cVultum dei quaerere\u201d was in some respects the most damaging object of the wrecking-ball pontificate to date.\nUnfortunately, it was about a subject that the world, and therefore the modern Church, cares so little about that hardly anyone noticed.\nAimed specifically at female contemplative religious, the document threatened that in a year or so another would be forthcoming laying out precisely what would now be required of nuns to continue in their vocations.\nThe new document issued last week, \u201cCor orans,\u201d is juridical, that is, it is not much more than a list of specific norms, or rules \u2013 289 of them!\n\u2013 that all communities of contemplative nuns must now follow.\nOne odd remark in article 19 is maybe the most succinct description of the direction planned for contemplatives:\n\u201cA monastery of nuns, as every religious house, is erected while keeping in mind its usefulness for the Church and for the Institute.\u201d (emphasis added)\nWait\u2026 its \u201cusefulness\u201d?\nI think a fair question for the Faithful to ask this Vatican department might be, \u201cAccording to what specific criteria is a monastery\u2019s \u2018usefulness\u2019 actually determined?\u201d\nOne can\u2019t help but hearken back to the criteria for monasteries that were allowed to survive the revolutionary purges in 18th and 19th century Europe.\nA house that could prove to the secularists that it was \u201cuseful\u201d \u2013 that it could care for the indigent elderly, teach children or nurse the sick \u2013 would be allowed to continue.\nThose which were purely contemplative \u2013 a single-minded devotion to the adoration of God \u2013 were closed.\nIt is not an insignificant quirk of modern history, and one that tells us much about the nature of the current pontificate, that houses of contemplatives are always attacked by secularist regimes, from Henry VIII to the Soviet Union.\nRupture?\nWhat rupture?\nThe first thing Cor orans does is claim continuity with both pre and post-Vatican II theology.\nIn the Introduction, it seems anxious to establish a \u201chermeneutic of continuity\u201d with Pius XII and his document Sponsa Christi Ecclesia of 1950.\nThe authors insist there is no contradiction between the two \u2013 except, of course, where there are contradictions \u2013 and that both Pius XII and Francis are keen to see nuns reaching the \u201caim of their specific vocation.\u201d It describes Francis as promulgating this document \u201cin the wake\u201d of Pius XII[1].\nIn fact, Pope Francis, by promulgating the Apostolic Constitution Vultum Dei quaerere, on June 29, 2016, to help the contemplatives reach the aim of their specific vocation, invited reflection and discernment on the precise content tied to consecrated life in general and to the monastic tradition in particular, but he did not intend to abrogate Sponsa Christi Ecclesia that was derogated only in some points.\nAs a consequence, the two pontifical documents are to be held as normative in force for monasteries of nuns and must be read in a unitary vision.\nBut of course, the entire game is given away in the next paragraph:\nPope Francis, in the wake of the teaching of Pope Pius XII and reaffirmed by Ecumenical Vatican Council II, intended to present in Vultum Dei quaerere the intense and fruitful path taken by the Church in the last decades, in the light of the teachings of the same Council and considering the changed socio-cultural conditions.\nYes, that\u2019s what it said.\nHere\u2019s my translation:\n\u201cThe Church\u2019s \u2018path\u2019 of the last 50 years has been \u2018fruitful\u2019.\nHow do you know?\nBecause we\u2019re telling you it has.\u201d\nIn other words, there have been absolutely no problems whatever with the direction taken either by the Church or by the religious life since Vatican II.\nEverything that has happened has been in complete and perfect continuity between the Before Church and the After Church; there has been no rupture or break with the past.\nAll changes undertaken by religious houses were perfectly legitimate and good - \u201cfruitful\u201d if, perhaps, a bit \u201cintense\u201d \u2013 and have been made in \u201clight of the teachings\u201d of Vatican II and \u201cchanged socio-cultural conditions.\u201d There is, therefore, no legitimate reason whatever for any religious house to attempt to \u201cturn back the clock\u201d to the pre-Vatican II norms or styles of religious life.\nAnyone attempting to do this are Bad Nuns [insert string of incomprehensible papal insults here.]\nThis is what might be considered the guiding principle of the document; \u201cNothing to see here.\nAnd if you say there is, you\u2019re the problem.\u201d\nOf course, this kind of bold proclamation is very much in keeping with the habit of this pontificate to simply claim there are no problems and become gravely offended and outraged when the contrary is pointed out.\nIt\u2019s your fault if you find contradictions, not theirs; they\u2019ve said there are no contradictions, therefore there aren\u2019t any.\nAfter all, this is the papacy where 2 + 2 = 5 if the pope says it does.\nThe irony, of course, is built in, since this document is intended as a legal chopping block for the dissolution of any house of contemplative nuns that is judged to be hovering on the edge of extinction or is for some other reason in need of the chop.\nWhy would the Vatican need a document giving extensive norms for the closure of monasteries that have too few nuns or do not follow their originally intended charisms if everything about the religious life since Vatican II has been hunky dory?\nLet\u2019s remember that this comes from the Congregation for Religious of Braz de\u2019Aviz and Jose Rodriguez Carballo.\nThis is the Cardinal Braz de\u2019Aviz[2] who wasted no time in orienting himself in the New Paradigm when, close on the heels of the Conclave he slammed the attempt by his predecessor \u2013 and by extension Pope Benedict \u2013 to reign in the notorious Leadership Conference of Women Religious in the US.\nHe complained that he had been shut out of the process under Cardinal Rode, and later made a large and public point of appeasing and mollifying the most outspokenly heretical and politicised organisation of female religious in the world.\nApparently the total statistical collapse of the religious life following Vatican II[3] had nothing to do with the massive systemic changes to the forms of that life \u2013 always claimed to be \u201cmandated\u201d by \u201cthe Council\u201d.\nAnd of course we are talking about the priorities of a pope who has said that seeing a \u201crestorationist\u201d community enjoying a large number of vocations makes him \u201cworry.\u201d Apparently this worry was serious enough to move him to torpedo one of the most flourishing communities in the modern Church; the gaunt spectre of the Franciscan Friars and Sisters of the Immaculate haunts this document.\nAutonomy vs.\nIndependence\nOne of the talking points the media have latched onto is the whole business of \u201cautonomy\u201d of monasteries.\nMany of the headlines crowed: \u201cVatican confirms nuns\u2019 autonomy,\u201d or similar.\nBut that word does not mean what they think it means.\nIn fact, the word \u201cautonomy\u201d is the key to understanding this whole thing.\nIt appears in the document 16 times and \u201cautonomous\u201d 30 times.\nIn fact, \u201cautonomy\u201d is held up as the single most important criterion for determining a monastery\u2019s viability.\nThis emphasis is repeated so often one might almost think there is a concern in Rome that the \u201cfruitful\u201d post-conciliar monastic life is in danger of fizzling out\u2026 for\u2026 some reason\u2026\nMonastery sui juris refers to the religious house of a female monastic community that, having the requisites for real autonomy of life, was legitimately erected by the Holy See and enjoys juridical autonomy under the law.\n18 In order to obtain juridical autonomy for a monastery of nuns, it must presuppose a real autonomy of life, that is, the ability to manage the life of the monastery in all its dimensions (vocational, formative, governmental, relational, liturgical, economic ...).\nIn this case, an autonomous monastery is alive and vital.\n43 Autonomy of life, a constant prerequisite for maintaining juridical autonomy, must be constantly verified by the Federal President who, when in her judgment a monastery lacks autonomy of life, must inform the Holy See in view of the nomination of an ad hoc commission.\n67 Affiliation [with another monastery, appointed by the Vatican] can be an opportunity for recovery and rebirth when autonomy of life is partially compromised.\nIf the situation of incapacity is irreversible, the solution, as painful as it is necessary, is the suppression of the monastery.\nno longer possesses a real autonomy of life , it is the responsibility of the Federation President to report the matter to the Holy See.\nWhen an autonomous monastery , it is the responsibility ofto the Holy See.\nAt the same time, this document is redefining the term \u201cautonomous\u201d to exclude independence.\nWhat got no mention in the brief press interest was the document\u2019s insistence that all monasteries of nuns must belong to a federation and while monasteries must demonstrate \u201cautonomy\u201d they will be granted little in the way of powers of self-governance.\nAs we will see, the federations are now a multilayered system of internal surveillance and centralised control that leaves Orwell in the dust:\novercome isolation and promote regular observance and contemplative life.\nFederation of monasteries means a structure of communion among some autonomous monasteries of the same Institute [4] , erected by the Holy See that approves the Statutes, so that in sharing the same charism, the federated monasteriesand promote regular observance and contemplative life.\nNote the change: \u201cindependent\u201d is replaced with \u201cisolated[5].\u201d It reminds me of a conversation I had with a superior of a Benedictine house in the UK.\nShe said she thought that the psychiatric testing, that in 2008 was still all the rage among the houses of her monastery\u2019s federation, was excessive and not helpful.\nShe didn\u2019t trust the heavily secularised field of psychology to help in determining a candidate\u2019s suitability for religious life, so she didn\u2019t require these tests of her monastery\u2019s postulants.\nShe also said that she was under constant pressure, both the subtle pressure of general peer disapproval and overt requests to conform by the federation\u2019s leadership.\nWas that monastery \u201cisolated\u201d?\nOr just exercising lawful self-governance?\nAnd given that autonomy is being held up as the sole criterion for viability of a monastery, it seems the Holy See is not interested in asking whether it is actually faithful to the charism, or even to the Catholic Faith, a question that has burned brightly for serious Catholics for some time.\nThe word \u201cfidelity\u201d appears in the document four times, which may give an idea of how much interest the Vatican has in this issue.\nFunny you should mention autonomy: Bioethics and the dissolution of \u201cunviable\u201d monasteries\nIt\u2019s funny that the buzzword of the day in Rome should be \u201cautonomy\u201d.\nAs we shall see, the document is what I\u2019ve called above a \u201cchopping block\u201d.\nVultum dei quaerere made it clear that this juridical document would provide a set of legal criteria by which a monastery can be considered viable, religious life worthy of life, so to speak, and that those considered to have failed the test would be closed.\nNote the language used here:\nIf the situation of incapacity is irreversible, the solution, as painful as it is necessary, is the suppression of the monastery.\nIt jogged a memory for me.\n\u201cIncapacity\u201d\u2026 Where had I heard that language used before?\nMost pro-life observers in Britain will tell you that it was the \u201cMental Capacity Act\u201d of 2005 that established in British law the concept that a person with permanently \u201creduced capacity\u201d could be legally starved and/or dehydrated to death by doctors.\nThis is the world, the language, of Bioethics, applied utilitarianism, also called \u201cPrinciplism\u201d after its three bioethical criteria of \u201cjustice, beneficence[6] and autonomy\u201d \u2013 it is a patient\u2019s ability to demonstrate his \u201cautonomy\u201d or \u201cquality of life,[7]\u201d either currently or potentially, that decides his fate.\nThis set of criteria is being applied in medical institutions across the western world now, a \u201cnew paradigm\u201d of ethics replacing traditional \u201cHippocratic\u201d or \u201cNatural Law\u201d medical ethics.\nUnder this system the onus, effectively, is on the patient to prove according to the new criteria that he is worthy of receiving medical treatment \u2013 of continuing to live.\nMedical treatment (which legally includes food and water) can be withdrawn from patients who fail to demonstrate that they will recover sufficiently to return to an autonomous lifestyle.\nHealth care systems like that of the UK have government regulatory boards giving out \u201cguidelines\u201d to determine in a uniform way how health care resources are allocated.\nThese guidelines are collated by professional Bioethicists applying their utilitarian criteria.\nIf the equation doesn\u2019t come out in the patient\u2019s favour, the \u201ctreatment\u201d recommended for the patient\u2019s \u201cbest interests\u201d will include his demise, often procured by withdrawing nutrition and hydration and/or administering slowly lethal doses of sedatives.\nThe NHS in the UK has actually gone to court, and won, declaring that they must retain the right to kill patients who fail the Bioethics test.\nThe result has been a quiet reign of terror in which elderly and disabled people have started carrying cards stating in legalese that they do not want to be killed by their doctors.\nIn one case a man with ALS took the NHS to court in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to preemptively preclude his medical murder when his illness left him incapacitated.\nThe system, in other words, is stacked against the patient, in favour of the government that holds all the cards.\nKeep these facts in mind as we read through the rest of the document.\nI think we can find an almost perfect analogy by replacing the term \u201cpatient\u201d with \u201cmonastery.\u201d Think about how one would apply concepts like \u201cautonomy,\u201d \u201cviability,\u201d \u201cincapacity,\u201d \u201cquality of life\u201d and \u201cequitable distribution of scarce resources\u201d to this context.\nWhen the language of utilitarianism appears in Vatican documents as guiding criteria for the contemplative religious life, one has to wonder at what point has the entire project gone so disastrously off the rails.\nFederations as Vatican watchdogs\nUnder this law, all monasteries of contemplative nuns must belong to a federation.\nPreviously only voluntary and consultative, federations will now have the power to supervise and guide the formation of candidates, nuns and of their formators, as well as possess broad powers over temporal goods of individual monasteries and powers of suppression.\nThe document makes it inarguable that the federation\u2019s main role will be to establish and monitor for conformity to a particular programme \u2013 the \u201cintense and fruitful path\u201d of the Church since 1965 \u2013 both within the various orders and between them:\nThe Federal Assembly:\ndeals with issues of major importance; makes decisions and issues norms that all nuns are required to observe, after the definitive approval of the Holy See;\nMore than just federations; a multi-tier system of control\nConference of monasteries means a structure of communion among autonomous monasteries, belonging to diverse Institutes and present in the same region... in particular geographical or linguistic contexts.\nIn other words, Benedictine federations of a given area will form a \u201cConference\u201d with Carmelite federations and Dominican federations and Poor Clare federations, etc.\nThis will be of interest to Carmelite houses especially, since they tend to be generally more on the \u201cconservative\u201d end of things.\nImagine a house of traditional Carmelites attending regional Conference meetings \u2013 and attempting to keep up their Office schedule \u2013 with the balloons-and-guitars, break dancing Franciscans\u2026What fun!\nAnd finally, just in case one entire federation decides to turn back the clock, there will be an umbrella for the umbrellas; there will be watchers watching the watchers:\nConfederation means a structure of connection among Federations of monasteries, erected by the Holy See that approves the Statutes, for the study of themes relative to contemplative life in relation to the same charism, to give unitary direction and a certain coordination to the activity of the individual Federations.\nBroad powers\nFederations will now have extremely broad powers both over money and property and, crucially, over formation of nuns.\nIt is the Federation that now has the power to monitor for compliance with the rules, to report non-compliance to the Holy See, to make new foundations and, apparently, to \u201cencourage\u201d individual monasteries to \u201ccommunicate\u201d their goods.\nThe legitimately established Federation is a public juridic person in the Church and is therefore able to acquire, possess, administer, and alienate temporal, movable and immovable goods, which are ecclesiastical assets, in accordance with the universal and proper law.\nTo keep alive and strengthen the union of monasteries, implementing one of the aims of the Federation, a certain communication of goods is encouraged among the monasteries, coordinated by the Federal President.\nThe communication of goods in a Federation is implemented through contributions, gifts, loans that monasteries offer other monasteries that have financial difficulties, and for the common needs of the Federation.\nThe Federation considers the assets in its possession as necessary and useful means to achieve its goals.\nFinancial incentives\nGiven that we shall see below that the provisions for suppression of monasteries include vague and indefinable qualities like \u201cvitality in living and transmitting the charism\u201d and \u201cdynamic fidelity\u201d to the order\u2019s charism, and that the goods of extinct monasteries will be assumed by the federation, one might be forgiven for asking if this creates an incentive to see to it that certain houses go extinct[8].\nSince the document provides several mechanisms by which a federation can move nuns out of a monastery, this could be one of those indelicate questions some superiors might want to keep in mind.\nArticle 94 requires that once it is canonically erected the federation is to seek \u201clegal recognition also in the civil sphere.\u201d This, presumably, will bear upon legal disputes in civil courts over the property of suppressed monasteries.\nArticle 73, on the disposition of the material assets of a monastery that has gone completely extinct:\nIn the event of the suppression of a totally extinct monastery, when there are no surviving nuns, unless otherwise provided by the Holy See, the destination of the suppressed monastery's assets, in compliance with canon and civil law, go to the respective higher juridical person, that is, to the Federation of monasteries or to another structure of communion among the monasteries equal to it or to the female monastic Congregation.\nThe economic fund [of the federation] is nourished by the free donations of the monasteries, by the donations of benefactors, and by revenues deriving from the alienation of the assets of suppressed monasteries, as established by the present Instruction.\nFederations in charge of formation\nThe Federation President, in particular, watches over initial and ongoing formation in the monasteries to see if it is in conformity with the charism proper to the Institute, so that every community may be a beacon that illumines the journey of the men and women of our time.\nAt the end of the visit, she will inform the Holy See about the real possibilities that the monastery has or does not have of guaranteeing initial formation.\nThe formation of the formators and their collaborators is entrusted in part to the monasteries and in part to the Federation, therefore, the President of the Federation is called to strengthen formation at the federal level and to require the participation of those who exercise the service of formation; if this does not happen, she will refer the matter to the Holy See.\nThe President of the Federation, having heard the opinion of the Federal Council, chooses the most appropriate places to hold the specific formative courses for the formators and their collaborators, as well as those who are called to exercise the service of authority, establishing the duration of these courses in such a way that they are not detrimental to the needs of the contemplative life and of the community.\nWho makes new foundations and why?\nThroughout the history of the Church, it has been the prerogative of bishops to establish houses of contemplatives in their own dioceses.\nNow, with the pope having forbidden bishops to exercise this ancient right, according to this document, the federations themselves can make foundations.\nthrough the action of the Federation, as established by the Federal Assembly The foundation of a monastery of nuns, keeping in mind what is established in no.\n39 of the present Instruction, can take place either by a single monastery or, as established by the Federal Assembly [9]\nA single monastic community that decides to make a foundation, moreover, must be \u201chelped\u201d and guided by the federation:\nIn discerning the foundation of a new monastery on the part of a single monastery, the Federal President and the religious Assistant intervene to help the Superior of the founding monastery.\nThe discernment on the foundation of a new monastery by the Federation is made within the framework of the Federal Assembly.\nArticle 39 tells us some criteria for making foundations that \u201cmust be considered in their entirety and from an overall perspective.\u201d\nthe necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism,\u201d composed of at least eight nuns of solemn vows, \u201cas long as most are not of advanced age\u201d.\na) A community that has given good testimony of fraternal life in common with \u201c\u201d composed of at least eight nuns of solemn vows, \u201cas long as most are not of advanced age\u201d.\nb) Besides the number, special skills are required of some nuns of the community who must be able to assume: as Superior, the service of authority; as formator, the initial formation of candidates; as financial administrator, the administration of the goods of the monastery.\nc) Rooms adapted to the lifestyle of the community, to ensure that the nuns can regularly lead the contemplative life according to the nature and spirit of their Institute.\nd) Economic conditions that guarantee the community itself can provide for the needs of daily life.\nOne of these things is not like the others.\nDid you notice?\nOne criterion stands out as indeterminate, vague, compared with the other concrete and measurable standards.\nOne aspect of legislative analysis that I learned early was that the terms used are of utmost importance.\nIf a term is vague or is defined incorrectly that is a \u201cloophole\u201d.\nOr it could perhaps be described as a handle; a place where a person who wants to effect a particular outcome can grasp a piece of legislation to use it like an axe.\nSo, how, exactly, is it to be determined \u2013 and by whom \u2013 that a group of nuns possess \u201cthe necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism\u201d?\nWhat, precisely, does the term \u201cvitality\u201d mean and exactly how is one to measure out how much is required?\nIs this one of Pope Francis little personal, secret expressions of which only he knows the meaning?\nLike the secret to how nuns are to smile properly?\nDoes the inclusion of completely subjective criteria belong in a juridical document?\nOr is it in there in order to provide cover for prelates?\nThe next article tells us, \u201cIt is the responsibility of the Holy See to evaluate the presence of these requisites.\u201d Do they have an electronic meter in a cupboard in the Congregation for Religious that measures \u201ccharism vitality\u201d?\nIt seems important to ask because article 70, on how to suppress a monastery, includes it:\nAmong the criteria that can contribute to determine a judgment concerning the suppression of a monastery, after having examined all the circumstances, the following points should be considered as a whole: the number of nuns, the advanced age of the majority of the members, the real capacity for government and formation, lack of candidates for a number of years, lack of the necessary vitality in living and transmitting the charism in dynamic fidelity[10].\nYou will be affiliated; resistance is futile\u2026\nIt seems there are two themes running through the document: to establish a certain value of \u201cautonomy\u201d as the indispensable criterion for viability, while at the same time asserting top-down oversight and control over who gets to make this determination.\nIn short, a monastery must be autonomous, but heaven help the community that asserts its independence.\nArticles 54-64 offer an interim measure in the case of \u201cincapacity\u201d that is really just more of the second thing.\nOnce a lack of autonomy has been established\u2026\n54 Affiliation is a particular form of help that the Holy See establishes in particular situations in favor of the community of a monastery sui juris which has only an asserted autonomy, but in reality, very precarious or, in fact, non-existent.\n55 Affiliation is configured as a juridical support that must assess whether the inability to manage the life of the autonomous monastery in all its dimensions is only temporary or is irreversible, helping the community of the affiliated monastery to overcome difficulties or to put in place what is necessary to bring about the suppression of this monastery.\nHow does affiliation work?\nWell, the federation and the Holy See between them work it out:\nIn these cases, it is up to the Holy See to evaluate the opportunity of setting up an ad hoc commission formed by the Ordinary, the Federation President, the Federal Assistant, and the Major Superior of the monastery\nIt\u2019s starting to be clear that the federation is going to be little more than the Big Brother hit-squad of the Congregation for Religious.\nIt\u2019s worth remembering what happened in the case of a German men\u2019s monastery in which the superior tried to return the community to pre-Vatican II practices.\nMariawald Trappist monastery \u2013 900 years old \u2013 was finally dissolved, affiliated to death.\nIts superior had made the fatal error of openly declaring \u2013 in 2008, after the publication of Summorum Pontificum \u2013 that the monastery\u2019s problems all began when it adopted the new liturgical rites and implemented the trends of all religious after Vatican II, and that clearly the solution was to go back to pre-conciliar ways.\nMariawald was consequently affiliated, in the manner this document describes, with a liberal house in the Netherlands whose superior, unsurprisingly, discovered that the house was hopelessly divided and could not be saved.\nWhat would make forced affiliation a truly devastating weapon against conservative or traditional communities is the proviso that an affiliated monastery may not form its own novices:\n60 The affiliated monastery can accept candidates, but the novitiate and initial formation must be performed in the affiliating monastery or in another monastery established by the Federation.\u201d\nOf course, this means it is the affiliating monastery\u2019s formation team that would make the determination to dismiss recalcitrant, \u201cneo-pelagian\u201d postulants and novices.\n~\nThis brings us to about article 155 of the document.\nPart two to come.\n_______________\n[1] It would seem, therefore, that a useful task for someone writing about what this pope intends for nuns would be to read Sponsa Christi Ecclesia as well as Francis\u2019 Apostolic Constitution and make a careful comparison.\nI\u2019m not going to do that here, but it might be helpful to examine the two documents with the help of a expert at some point.\n[2] Worth remembering, however, is the fact that it was Benedict the \u201cconservative,\u201d not Francis, who appointed Braz de\u2019 Aviz in the office to replace Cardinal Rode \u2013 presumably under that good old \u201cconservative\u201d rubric of the \u201cbig umbrella\u201d \u2013 under whom these culpably belated attempts to save US religious life were started.\n[3] Just considering the numbers of course.\nLeaving alone the doctrinal issues.\n[4] \u201cThe same Institute\u201d means the order in question, whether Benedictine, Dominican, Carmelite etc.\n[5] I\u2019d love to hear from some monastic superior who had the nerve to tell Rome, \u201cActually, given that all our neighbours in religion are raging neo-modernist heretics, if not schismatics, we think \u2018isolation\u2019 is a desirable thing \u2013 like quarantine during an outbreak of Bubonic Plague \u2013 and would therefore like to be dispensed from the federation requirement.\u201d I\u2019d pay good money to see the shade of purple the well-fed Braz de\u2019Aviz turned.\n[6] \u201cjustice and beneficence\u201d are considered on behalf of the community, not the patient\n[7] Bioethicists take it as read that in order for a life to have sufficient \u201cquality\u201d it must demonstrate sufficient autonomy.\nDependence upon the care of others is, quite literally, a capital offence.\n[8] Readers may think I\u2019m exaggerating the danger of material motivations for suppressing monasteries, but as we will see, the distinction between the federations and the Holy See is also a matter of paperwork and it is well to recall that the secretary for the Congregation for Religious, Jose Rodrigues Carballo, was a person of interest to international police agencies for the loss of \u201ctens of millions\u201d of Euros from the coffers of the Franciscan Friars Minor, the original Franciscan order of which he had been the head.\nShortly after Carballo\u2019s appointment, it was revealed that the Swiss prosecutor\u2019s office was investigating the money missing from the Friars Minor in connection with drugs, money laundering operations and gun running.\nCarballo was Francis\u2019 very first appointment, April 6, 2013, three weeks after the Conclave and it was to him that the pope gave the task of the destruction of the FFIs, and a major part of that operation was to separate the FFIs from real assets valued at about 30 million Euros.\n[9] So much for the principle of subsidiarity.\nI can imagine what a monastery founded by a committee would be like to live in.\n[10] We\u2019ll pass over \u201cdynamic fidelity\u201d in silence for now\u2026\n", ["Repetition",

emitting \"infrasounds\", which are low frequency noises that can affect human hearing if they are loud enough.\nHowever, Dr Toby Heys told the New Scientist in 2017 that an infrasound attack wouldn't

an \"ultrasound\" attack, whereby a high frequency noise inaudible to human ears can be targeted easily at potential victims.\nThey can damage parts of the ear such as hairs that pick up sounds, but again it is reported that large equipment would be needed for such an attack.\nOther theories behind the health issues in Cuba include the use of electromagnetic weapons, which can target highly-focused energy at potential victims.\nThis can include a laser, microwaves, or particle beams.\nInvestigators also speculated that a flawed spy device could be behind the victims' ailments in Cuba.\nThe US expelled 15 Cuban diplomats from the US after the alleged acoustic attacks.\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo met with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi in Washington on Wednesday.\nThey

(thanks to Todd):\nAfter former Democratic IT aide Imran Awan allegedly threatened his stepmother not to talk to police, her email account was accessed in suspicious ways and a lawyer for one of Awan\u2019s brothers found out she emailed the FBI on specific dates and lashed out at her: \u201cYou\u2019re a liar, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Days after that, a bank account the stepmother controlled was almost completely drained through a payment to Imran\u2019s brother, Abid Awan, bank records show \u2014 but she said she is too afraid to press criminal charges because she claims he has threatened her.\nThe stepmother, Samina Gilani, also previously said Imran stole two laptops from her.\nImran, Abid and Jamal Awan \u2014 along with Imran\u2019s wife, Hina Alvi, and a friend \u2014 worked as IT administrators for 1 out of every 5 House Democrats and could read all their emails and files until police banned them from the network in February 2017for \u201cnumerous violations of House security policies.\u201d Months later, none of the family is in jail, and the stepmother and other witnesses have said Imran and Abid have used their freedom to try to steer the outcome of the case since, including by threatening them not to cooperate with authorities, TheDCNF previously reported.\nIn April 2016, the House\u2019s Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) detected allegedly falsified purchase orders, and the Inspector General quickly expanded the scope to investigate cyber violations, finding that members of the Awan family improperly accessed congressmen\u2019s servers and the House Democratic Caucus server thousands of times.\nThough House officials suspected that equipment was being stolen, the Capitol Police did not search their homes, The Daily Caller News Foundation learned, and did not ban them from the network until nearly a year later.\nIn the meantime, evidence appears to have been compromised: In December 2016, the CAO notified congressmen that the caucus server had physically disappeared.\nThough Abid played a prominent role in the late-2016 IG report, he has not been arrested, with congressmen saying a criminal investigation is ongoing.\nIn January 2017, in the days around his father\u2019s death, Abid removed Gilani as the beneficiary of his father\u2019s life insurance and replaced her with himself, which led to a lawsuit, TheDCNF previously reported.\nAbid\u2019s attorney, Jim Bacon, used the life insurance lawsuit to force Gilani to sit for a sworn deposition Oct. 4, 2017 in which he told her to reveal what she told the FBI about the congressional criminal probe and tried to get her to find out details from investigators.\nIn one exchange, Bacon knew that she had emailed with the FBI.\nBACON Q: [redacted] is your

Muslims add to the religious tapestry of American life,\u201d or is Ramadan \u201ca month of calamity everywhere for nonbelievers\u201d?\nIslam\u2019s core beliefs make it clear that the latter statement is closer to the truth.\nDuring Ramadan, Muslims are exhorted to renew and deepen their devotion to Allah.\nHence it is a time when they\u2019re supposed to grow more generous and kind toward their fellow Muslims.\nHowever, the Qur\u2019an says: \u201cMuhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves\u201d (48:29).\nIf the Ramadan imperative is to become more devout, the Muslim who applies himself diligently to the Ramadan observance will simultaneously become more both merciful to his fellow Muslims and more severe against the unbelievers.\nMurdering infidels thus doesn\u2019t contradict the spirit of Ramadan; it embodies it.\nThe Kavkaz Center, a website operated by Chechen jihadists, explained in a 2010 article that the idea of Ramadan as a time for warfare against infidels went back to Muhammad\u2019s time: \u201cThe month of Ramadan in the life of the Prophet (pbuh) and the righteous ancestors was a month of forthcoming.\nThe greatest battles during the lifetime of the Prophet (pbuh) occurred in this blessed month, the month of jihad, zeal and enthusiasm.\u201d\nTrump was, unfortunately, following the example of his two immediate predecessors when he claimed that \u201cRamadan reminds us of the richness Muslims add to the religious tapestry of American life,\u201d and was severely misleading the American people.\nIronically, even in doing this he is likely to fail to satisfy Muslims, or anyone.\nAfter all, after the Trump White House issued a similar statement last year, the Washington Post ran a lengthy piece in which several Muslims explained why the statement was unsatisfactory to them.\nShadi Hamid of the Qatar-funded Brookings Institution declared: \u201cTrump has so rarely recognized that American Muslims even exist, but this offers apparent proof that he is aware of our existence.\nGreat!\nPutting all that context aside, it\u2019s offensive and pretty much terrible.\u201d\nWhy?\nBecause Trump had the temerity to mention jihad terrorism.\nHamid continued: \u201cWe, as American Muslims, shouldn\u2019t be defined solely in our relationship to bad things that we have nothing to do with.\nWe\u2019re also normal people who happen to be Muslim and to see us and our history in America so narrowly is plain out offensive.\u201d\nWhat is actually offensive is that Hamid would try in this way to absolve the Muslim community of any responsibility to root out jihad terrorist from its midst.\nThere is certain to be more jihad terrorism during this Ramadan, and some of it may be committed by Muslims in the U.S. Hamid, if he cared about this, would be confronting honestly the teachings of Islam that make Ramadan the month of jihad, and working to reform them.\nMeanwhile, it would be dangerous, suicidal folly for Infidels to pretend that Ramadan is not the month of jihad.\nAnd as our Ramadan willful blindness continues, more Infidels will die.\nArticle posted with permission from Robert Spencer\n", ["Repetition", "Appeal_to_fear-prejudice", "Loaded_Language", "Causal_Oversimplification",

[of the Rule of St. Benedict] set this choice before us, the world or Our Lord, as mutually exclusive alternatives; we cannot remain neutral, but must belong wholly to the one or wholly to the other.\u201d\nDom Paul Delatte, OSB, Abbot of Solesmes\nToday I received an email from a monastery of cloistered Carmelite nuns about the new document from the Vatican\u2019s Congregation for Religious.\nThey\u2019re helping me examine this document, having kindly volunteered to serve as consultants, to help me understand it from an inside position.\nThese, I might add, are not what we would consider a \u201ctraditionalist\u201d community.\nThey have only the Novus Ordo Mass and use the new rite Divine Office in their native vernacular language.\nFor obvious reasons I can\u2019t identify them, even to say what country they are in.\nWriting to me in English, by way of introductory comments in their longer analysis of the document that will be forthcoming, Sister T, fully professed and a senior member of the monastery\u2019s council, said, \u201cThe Cor Orans document is the death-knell of Carmel.\nIt signals the end of the contemplative monastic life.\nNot only does it destroy the autonomy of the Monasteries, something Our Holy Mother St. Teresa was extremely insistent about, but it also removes the Superior, dissolves her authority and power, removes the financial independence of each Monastery, and destroys the specificity of each charism.\n\u201cThis is a disaster.\nEspecially for Carmel.\u201d\nI contrast this frightening comment with those coming from the man immediately responsible for \u201cCor orans,\u201d Cardinal Jo\u00e3o Braz de Aviz, the Brazilian prefect of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life in a speech to religious formation directors in 2015, in which he laid out pretty clearly what was coming in this piece of legislation, 3 years later.\nIn fact, as the National Catholic Reporter piece said, the meeting itself was \u201cunprecedented,\u201d 1200 formators of religious life gathered by the Congregation for Religious in order to hear the new marching orders.\nThis is the programme:\n\u201cDo not distance yourself from the great lines of the Second Vatican Council.\u201d \u201cIn fact, those that are distancing themselves from the council to make another path are killing themselves \u2013 sooner or later, they will die.\nThey will not have sense.\nThey will be outside the church.\nWe need to build, using the Gospel and the Council as a departure point.\u201d\nAfter breathing this threat, the cardinal continued, saying that because modern people\u2019s \u201cneeds\u201d are fundamentally different from what they were in the past, there was no reason to stick too closely to what the founders and foundresses \u2013 people like St. Anthony, St. Augustine, St. John Cassian, St. Benedict, St. Bruno, St. Dominic, Sts.\nFrancis and Clare, Sts.\nTeresa of Avila and John of the Cross - wanted.\n\u201cThese contexts have changed.\nAnd the council reminds us that consecrated life must be Christian discipleship ... must be discipleship of the founders that we remember, but also must be open to the culture of the present moment.\u201d\n\u201cWe must not be closed to new things.\nGod is not static,\u201d the cardinal said.\n\u201cGod is always new movement \u2013 of light, of heat, of demonstration.\nHe speaks in every time to men and women with the true language of that time.\u201d\nThe congregation\u2019s Secretary, Archbishop Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez Carballo, is reported as saying, \u201cWith this explicit reference to the Second Vatican Council, we point to our profound conviction that the council is the point of reference, non-negotiable, in the formation to the consecrated life.\u201d\nNot the charism of the order, nor the rule, nor the Patristic tradition, nor the Doctors, nor the mystics, nor any of the 2000-year-old tradition of religious life, from the Desert Fathers to the giants of the Tridentine period; just Vatican II.\nAnd only, apparently, a single \u201cinterpretation\u201d of it, if we are to judge by the soap and oil Braz de Aviz poured on the ruffled feathers of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious \u2013 the most virulently anti-Catholic organisation of \u201cCatholic\u201d religious in the world \u2013 and by his vicious persecution of the Franciscans of the Immaculate.\nCarballo continues his remarks, giving us a clue as to his feelings towards strictly cloistered, contemplative religious life: \u201cA consecrated life, a life in God but inserted in the ecclesial family, in the church \u2013 inserted in the world.\nNot in conflict with the world, but inserted in continuity,\u201d he said.\nIt is to wonder what this man would make of a comment by the great Dom Paul Delatte, the second abbot of Solesmes and successor to the refounder, Dom Gueranger, who wrote in his commentary on the Rule of St. Benedict:\n\u201cThe Prologue set this choice before us, the world or Our Lord, as mutually exclusive alternatives; we cannot remain neutral, but must belong wholly to the one or wholly to the other.\u201d\n\u201cAfter entering into Christ by baptism and by the monastic profession, we should hold ourselves as far aloof from the world as possible and have no connection with it.\nThere shall no longer be more intercourse between us than there is between two corpses: \u2018The world is crucified to me and I to the world.\u2019\n\u201cLet us be on our guard against thinking that it may sometimes be proper to soften the differences, to lessen the distance which separates us.\nThe Apostle warns us that we can only please God by preserving the integrity of our true life: \u2018No man being a soldier to God, entangleth himself with secular businesses: that he may please him to whom he hath engaged himself.\u2019 The world itself is scandalised by our condescending to it, and the words of the Imitation [of Christ] are always fulfilled: \u2018Sometimes we think to please others by our company; whereas we begin rather to be displeasing to them by reason of the bad qualities they discover in us.\u2019\u201d\nHow Cor orans will end St. Teresa of Avila\u2019s reform of Carmel\nSister T. continued, saying that the document explicitly derogates the founding intentions of St. Teresa for whom real autonomy was a crucial element of her Carmelite reform.\nShe acknowledges that cloistered orders of nuns have for some time been gathered into federations.\nThese are already doing the Cor orans programme, having shared initial formation programmes for postulants and novices, \u201congoing formation\u201d courses for professed nuns, a federal abbess or president who oversees all the federated monasteries.\nTheir funds are already interconnected and they have regular meetings with and input from the male branches.\nIn 2015, Carmelite monasteries received a questionnaire from the Father General Fr.\nSaverio Cannistra, a Mexican and devotee of Liberation Theology, to ask if they wanted an International Commission of Nuns to oversee the female houses place of the Carmelite Fathers.\nThis suggestion was rejected, to the annoyance of Maccise.\nMaccise also promoted the idea of having no superiors in the individual monasteries, but only federation presidents and shared formation of novices.\nThe push for these changes is still on, however, under the current General, an Italian, Saverio Cannistr\u00e0.\nGiven the Marxist leanings of the recent crop of Fathers General, it seems clear that what can be expected by \u201congoing formation\u201d is, in essence, some form of political indoctrination, sprayed over with a micro-thin layer of pious language.\nBut for Carmelite nuns, Sister said, these ideas are the antithesis of the intentions of St. Teresa.\nAuthentic autonomy, independence of formation and finances, \u201care essential points of our charism that Our Holy Mother established and to do away with them is to do away with the charism.\u201d\n\u201cThey go against our Constitutions, even though Cor Orans states that everything is to be done in accord with the charism and Constitutions.\nEach Carmel has its own spirit, its own tempo, it\u2019s own \u2018feel.\u2019 Each nun is called not just to the Order, but to a specific Carmel.\nFormation in common is something we\u2019ve been fighting against for years.\u201d\n\u201cTo have a federal president who can decide to take the novices away, or take all our finances, or tell the Holy See we\u2019re no longer \u2018viable\u2019 \u2013 this is a disaster.\nSt. Teresa specifically set up the monasteries so that none of this would take place.\nAnd now it\u2019s going to be done to us.\u201d\nShe points to the extended length of formation for new nuns - previously six years for Carmelites and under Cor orans now nine years, as absurd, saying it will tend to impede new vocations.\n\u201cAs though the Church is going to ask laypeople to be engaged for nine years before they marry.\nOur Constitutions already provide a three year extension of temporary vows if needed, but to make it mandatory will dissuade women from entering.\nIt will also help the monastery become \u2018less viable\u2019 because by the time anyone younger is professed, the others will be dead.\u201d\nAnother requirement will be for a \u201creligious assistant,\u201d a priest monitoring the monastery in addition to a chaplain, to be assigned by the federation.\nSister writes that this was rejected \u201cyears ago\u201d by Carmelite monasteries as undue interference.\nThe religious assistant will have unprecedented powers.\nArticle 23 states, for instance, \u201cIn discerning the foundation of a new monastery on the part of a single monastery, the Federal President and the religious assistant intervene to help the superior of the founding monastery.\nThe discernment on the foundation of a new monastery by the Federation is made within the framework of the Federal Assembly.\u201d\n\u201cOne other thing that is very striking to me is the complete loss of our rights.\nThere are no options in this document, no choices, no recourse.\nIt\u2019s all being done to us.\nIn this day and age, when Pope Francis is proclaiming, if not Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, then at least license and \u2018choice\u2019 for all, plus the \u2018rights\u2019 of women, here our rights are completely taken away.\u201d\nAnother nun has written saying that they cannot conceive of what these people mean by \u201congoing formation\u201d.\nJudging from other documents from already-federated Carmelites in Europe, it means in practical terms going in groups away from the monastery for days or weeks at a time to take \u201ccourses\u201d together with novices from other monasteries.\nThe content of these course, of course, is to be formulated by teams of \u201cexperts\u201d chosen by the Federation.\nSister writes, \u201cCloistered nuns have a very full horarium that does not allow for a lot of other things.\nWe already have to deal with the million unexpected things that come up each day.\nI have no idea how we are going to implement all these ridiculous plans of \u2018on-going formation\u2019.\nCan they not comprehend that simply faithfully living our daily life provides plenty of on-going formation.\u201d\nApparently not.\nAs I wrote in my first analysis piece, the document itself \u2013 that we must remember is a piece of legislation, a legal document laying out what all monasteries of contemplative nuns must now do \u2013 starts by laying out its working premise:\nPope Francis, in the wake of the teaching of Pope Pius XII and reaffirmed by Ecumenical Vatican Council II, intended to present in Vultum Dei quaerere the intense and fruitful path taken by the Church in the last decades, in the light of the teachings of the same Council and considering the changed socio-cultural conditions.\nIn other words, it is the \u201cintense and fruitful path\u201d of the last few decades of the Church since Vatican II that all monasteries of cloistered, contemplative nuns must now take.\nAnyone who imagines that this document\u2019s authors will allow leeway, that there will be dispensations forthcoming for traditional or \u201cconservative\u201d communities from timid and cowed Vatican bodies like Ecclesia Dei, has failed to pay attention.\nIn the last 20 years, \u201cconservative\u201d Catholics have pointed to the flourishing \u2013 mainly in the US \u2013 of some groups of sisters who had turned away from the \u201cintense and fruitful path\u201d and re-established some of the traditional accoutrements of the religious life.\nThey point to the Nashville Dominicans, the Missionaries of Charity, the Poor Clares of Alabama, where there are at least habits, (some) chant, common life and common apostolates.\nBut it is these signs of refusal of the programme that have infuriated the despots of the New Paradigm who would not rest until every last individual house of religious life was co-opted, subverted to the new ideology.\nThe little green shoots of hope that the faithful Catholic world so rejoiced to see are to be stamped back into the frost of Vatican II\u2019s perpetual winter.\nIn the continuing analysis that will follow this article, we can see that the purpose of this document is to fulfill the totalitarian fantasies of the anti-Catholic revolutionaries, now nearing the end of their lives 50 years after their initial near-triumph.\nIts intention is mopping up; either to herd the remaining recalcitrants \u2013 those who have resisted even to the softened and conciliating degrees typical of \u201cconservatives\u201d \u2013 into the full post-conciliar \u201creform\u201d instituted by the revolutionaries in the 1960s \u2013 or to close them.\nThe thing is, the result will obviously be the same either way.\nThe whole world has seen what happens to religious life that takes on the VaticanTwoist New Paradigm.\nI have just received a document that was issued privately summarising the findings of a meeting of federated Discalced Carmelite nuns in Europe in 2009.\nThe numbers are absolutely dismal.\nFederation: Belgium\nnumber of convents: 11 Number of nuns: 120\nsolemnly professed: 119\nin formation: 1 average age: 73\nFederation: Belgium - Luxembourg.\nnumber of convents: 11

66\nThe rest are similar, and I\u2019ll be analysing this document in some detail in the next piece in this series, but the rest of the responses to the Father General\u2019s questionnaire tell a similar story.\nThe German federation gave a summary of the efforts made to address these issues.\n\u201cPath taken: For 15 years they have organized formation courses: on-going & initial formation, and for formators.\nMeetings for prioresses.\nPresent Problems: Have got very old.\nSome sisters are in care-homes run by Franciscans.\nPossible Solutions: Two convents intend to amalgamate.\u201d\nThis is the death spiral.\nAnd it is precisely this \u201cintense and fruitful path\u201d taken by nearly all the Catholic world\u2019s monastics since 1965 that Cor orans is attempting to force on the very, very few holdouts.\n", ["Repetition", "Appeal_to_fear-prejudice", "Black-and-White_Fallacy", "Exaggeration,Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling,Labeling"]], ["A Dismal Record: Why Are They Destroying the Nuns?\nThe meeting covered Carmels of the Teresian, Discalced, reform from Germany, five areas of Spain, three from France, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Croatia and the Holy Land [1] .\nThe reports from each region showed that many of the provisions found in Cor orans were already in place: federations with broad powers, including financial control and combined formation courses, \u201creligious assistant\u201d priests appointed by the federation and overseeing individual monasteries and superiors giving up their authority to the federations.\nGiven that this was 2009, it is clear that the plans to force all contemplative monasteries in the world into this disastrous European mould were well under way long before Pope Benedict was even considering resigning.\nToday I\u2019ve received an interesting document issued by the Carmelite Order in Europe following a meeting of the \u201cFederations of Discalced Carmelite Nuns of Europe & the Holy Land\u201d in Avila, February 2009.\nAs a snapshot of the current condition of Carmelite monastic life after it had been completely \u201cfederated,\u201d it paints a depressing picture; but as a demonstration of what \u201cfederations\u201d are likely to achieve once Cor orans is implemented universally, it clangs in the mind like a funeral bell.\nReconciled to managed extinction\nThe report shows average ages of nuns between 65 and 80, \u201cinfirmary Carmels,\u201d nuns in state nursing homes, entire communities living in care facilities and half the Carmels with no one in formation.\nSolutions offered are equally uniform: heaped-up bureaucracy, common formation courses between monasteries developed by \u201creligious psychologists,\u201d ever more powers handed to federations.\nThis is federated Carmelite monastic life under Pope Francis\u2019 New Paradigm of fully implemented VaticanTwoism.\nVery little is said of any efforts being made to increase vocational outreach using the internet or through diocesan contacts.\nAnd perhaps most telling of all, not one word is offered of applying any systematic religious solutions; no one is suggesting increased prayer or fasting, Rosary campaigns or novenas in what has to be the Carmelite Order\u2019s most desperate hour.\nNothing is said of increased intensity of devotion to the charism, study of the foundress or returning to sources, still less of strengthening the Carmelites\u2019 traditional independent self-governance or reconsidering the wisdom of \u201cthe path taken\u201d.\nIndeed, in one case in Spain, the sisters themselves advocate abandoning traditional Teresian autonomy altogether.\nThe report from Great Britain notes: \u201c18 Carmels have closed in the last 40 years.\nThere have been two amalgamations in recent years and another one involving three Carmels is in process.\nTwo communities at present are living together in one monastery as a temporary measure.\u201d\nThe case of the Netherlands is downright bizarre; sisters so old that even the federation structures are breaking down.\nOnly one fully autonomous functioning Carmel still exists in the Netherlands, and the remains of four entire communities are living in a single care home run by religious brothers.\nBut in this situation, the \u201csolution\u201d undertaken has been an elaborate bureaucratic reshuffle, including gaining approval from Rome, for \u201ca completely new structure,\u201d whose main task, no doubt, will be the making of funeral arrangements and disposing of library books.\nThe atmosphere is weirdly resigned \u2013 one federation report recommended simply \u201cforgetting the numbers\u201d \u2013 with many notes of mutual congratulation over \u201cunity,\u201d the creating of \u201clinks\u201d and the \u201cbuilding of trust\u201d and \u201cdialogue\u201d between communities.\nThe report from Belgium \u2013 federated in 1997, average age 73 with one sister in formation for 11 monasteries \u2013 states tersely that their biggest problem is \u201cageing\u201d but under \u201cpossible solutions\u201d says only, \u201cWe want to continue along the path we have begun.\u201d\nIt is only in the report from Croatia where the problem changes abruptly from aging nuns and no vocations to too many vocations with not enough room[2].\nIt is also notable that it is only in the Croatian report that Christ gets a direct mention.\nFederation of Croatia & Bosnia-Herzegovina: 82 nuns in 5 convents, with an average age of 47, and eleven in formation.\nThis outlier differs from the Western European federations in several respects, notably that it was only federated in 2002.\nBut the effects of the federating/formation courses are already being felt: \u201cNowadays, two monasteries have difficulty because of a lack of vocations.\u201d\nPath taken: Have made a foundation in Albania; however this community is not federated.\nFrom the beginning, our Association has organized formation courses for the younger sisters as well as courses of permanent formation.\nEach year, we have one or two seminars, which are also the occasion to the meeting of the Council of the Association.\nThe duration is 3 to 4 days and they take place every time in a different Monastery of the Association.\nWe invite the sisters of other Carmelite convents friends to our formation courses: sisters from Albania, Slovenia and Bulgaria.\nPresent Problems: In general, in our Association the vocations continue growing, but there are differences between the monasteries.\nNowadays, two monasteries have difficulty because of a lack of vocations.\nPossible solutions: We do all what is in our hands in the area of the vocational promotion, collaborating in this way with Christ who calls by his Spirit.\nThese self-generated reports were made in response to a questionnaire set out for the meeting.\nAll speak of nothing but bureaucratic responses: shared \u201cformation courses,\u201d meetings of superiors, amalgamations and suppression of houses and finally \u201ccare homes\u201d and houses given over

systematic formation of the communities.\nThey have established a formation-house for new vocations and held a month long intensive course according to the ratio, given by the same sisters of the federation.\nIn 2004 they established a Carmelite infirmary to help the communities.\nCourses have been organized to accompany the youngest sisters of the federation, given by a religious psychologist.\nPresent problems: ageing of the sisters and a lack of vocations; we have not arrived at any practical conclusion in the way of amalgamations-restructuring though attempts have been made.\nThe incorporation of sisters from other countries without due discernment in some cases.\nPossible solutions: we are making enquiries.\n~~~\nFederation: Spain - Catalonia\nDate when erected:

of the communities, resulting in weakening of life in all its facets.\nIt is not easy to express the reality.\nA lack of vocations is with us as a reality in everyday life.\nMoreover, the high number of Carmels makes difficult to maintain all presences.\nPossible Solutions: It is completely necessary to assume the way of the restructurings, in order to live what is essential, forgetting the numbers.\nThe challenge to grow in confidence and communion should lead us to downgrade the famous and untouchable autonomy because, to a daughter of Saint Teresa, the really important thing is to look for HIM and to live in obedience.\nAnother of our challenges is caring [for] the ecclesial presences.\nWe think this is the way will lead us to recreate from the interior the Charism of the

formation through courses.\nAlso on communion between the communities.\nThere are meetings of the Council with the communities.\nWe are ready to accept sisters who cannot be cared for in their own communities.\nHowever, this has not been accepted because they do not want to be separated.\nThe strangest report came from the Netherlands where, for a single surviving autonomous monastery and an average age of 81, resources were mobilised to create \u201ca completely new structure,\u201d complete with approval from the Congregation for Religious:\nFederation: Netherlands\nDate when erected: 1971\nNumber of convents: 6\nNumber of nuns: 73\nSolemnly professed: 73\nIn formation: ....\nAverage age: 81 [NB, the bold was in the original.]\nWhat has been done: 13 Dutch Carmels and one in Iceland have united in a Federation.\nThis has created a close communion from the beginning.\nEveryone has collaborated in the process of amalgamations and suppressions.\nPresent Problems: Only one Carmel functions fully autonomously in the Netherlands.\n4 communities are in a care-home run by the Brothers of the Immaculate Conception.\nAnother Carmel was renewed in 1990.\nAt the original Carmel an infirmary wing has been added for those sisters who require nursing; it is run by Franciscan sisters.\nWith the passing of time the Assembly of the Federation has transferred tasks to the President of the Federation, according to the faculties described in the statutes, in particular regarding our mutual solidarity.\nAlso, with the passing of the years, the Congregation for Religious has placed responsibility directly into the hands of the Council of the Federation.\nFinally, the autonomous Carmels have asked help from the Federation in order to protect their interests.\nDue to our very advanced age in the Netherlands we have reached the moment when a General Assembly is no longer possible.\nWe are left with the problem that in the communities there are no sisters who can or who want to be prioresses or council sisters.\nThe structure of the Federation that we have had till now is thus no longer possible.\nPossible solutions: The Federation Council, the Religious Assistant, together with a canon lawyer of the Dutch Conference of Religious, have worked hard on a completely new structure, in which in its first draft the autonomy of the Carmel has been constantly kept in mind.\nWe began from three points:\n1)Maintenance of the formal autonomy of the Carmels that still exist, but with the chance to transfer tasks gradually to the council of the Federation.\n2)Appointment of The Federal board or Federal Council of the Federation, preferably appointed by the Superior General.\nThe team will consist of a president and vice-president who are members of one of the convents, appointed to functions, and of three people who are members, or not, of one of the convents.\n3)A Supervisory council, also to be appointed periodically by the Superior General, which will be made up of three members, whose president will be, preferably, a member of a religious institute, preferably of the Carmelite Order and appointed to functions.\nThis council sees itself as a supervisory body and to give advice that will more or less replace the Assembly of the Federation.\nIn October 2008, the President, the Religious Assistant and a Lawyer were in Rome where they explained the proposals.\nThey had meetings with Fr.\nGeneral and with the Congregation for Religious.\nThese were open meetings that helped us to clarify matters.\nAn important concern was that they would allow us to use lay people on the Federal Council of the Federation and the Supervisory council.\nWe were aware that we were not dealing with a simple matter, but we think that, in view of our present situation today, we do not have much choice.\nIt is important to continue to protect the interests of our Federation in the most responsible and careful way, so that all the sisters, even those advanced in years, can continue to live their life in Carmel.\nDefinitive permission came at the 25th of February.\n~~~\nGiven this incredible picture of a Carmelite Order in the last rattle of its death throes, the rest of the summaries of speeches given at the meeting in Avila read as outright surreal, leaving us to wonder if any of these people are attached in any way to reality.\nSr. Enrica Rosanna, the representative of the Vatican\u2019s Congregation for Religious told them that the \u201ctwo great challenges to our contemplative life\u201d are \u201cthe challenge of globalization and the challenge of irrelevancy.\u201d She warned the nuns against bringing vocations from other countries to keep their monasteries alive, dropping a hint about what now seems to be a particular obsession of the Congregation.\nCor orans would take this subject up definitively in 2018:\nThe nuns were exhorted to \u201cstay awake to welcome the dawn\u201d of a bright new future:\n\u201cThese are difficult and uncertain times, but it is also the time to stay awake as the new dawn is already announcing itself.\u201d \u201cOur aim must be to be open to the future.\nWe should not forget that we are following in the tradition of Teresa of Jesus and in the tradition of all those who have followed in her footsteps.\nIt is a wide road that opens up before us.\nWe must be women of hope and faith.\nWe must always believe that God is the one who directs history.\nFrom this derives our task, to be creative and, at the same time, faithful (creative fidelity).\u201d [emphasis in the original.]\nWhile there can be no doubt that the impending total extinction of the Carmelite Order in Western Europe was foremost in the minds of the nuns present, it seems that the issue was simply not addressed out loud by the representatives of the bureaucracy.\nInstead, Sr. Enrica, after this bizarre and cryptic comment, spoke of the \u201cproblems and difficulties that we can encounter\u201d in discernment of mostly non-existent vocations, including \u201cconsumerism, modern means of communication, difficulties in creating a stable personality, autonomy of the young, the need to be always supported, the ideology of subjectivism.\u201d\nWhat are these people smoking?\nGiven that this was three years or more from the abdication of Benedict and the installation of the New Paradigm of Francis/Kasper, one wonders what this \u201cnew dawn\u201d was actually about.\nPerhaps a useful question for one of the nuns present could have been, \u201cA \u2018new dawn\u2019 of what, exactly?\u201d This kind of coded language has been popular with the progressivist faction in the Church since the 1960s, when the expectation was for the installation of a totally new Church.\nWas Sr. Enrica somehow anticipating the fulfillment of those hippie-era dreams in the years to come?\nIt is certainly clear from Francis\u2019 first acts as pope that he had dealing with conservative and Traditionalist nuns high on his list of priorities.\nHis first appointment, no more than three weeks after the Conclave was Jose Rodrigues Carballo, the Religious Congregation\u2019s Secretary and \u2013 given the scandal that erupted on his leaving them \u2013 the financial wrecking ball of the Franciscan Friars Minor.\nThe first task Francis gave Carballo was the demolition of the Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate.\nCertainly this record of the European Carmelites\u2019 meeting is jammed with hints that Cor orans was on the way.\nOn the final day of the meeting, the \u201ctheme for the day\u201d was offered by then-Father General Luis Arostegui: \u201cGovernment: the need for change.\nAutonomy and Association; autonomy and Fr.\nGeneral; other solutions to government.\u201d\nThe devolution of authority of superiors of individual monasteries to federations was obviously on someone\u2019s mind, as was a plan to see to it that monasteries change superiors frequently: \u201cEssential autonomy can fail due to the relationships within the community: abuses by permanent superiors who decide on the freedom and decisions of the community,\u201d the Father General warned.\nAnd there were certainly hints that a general re-organisation of structures of authority was in the works.\nA common tactic of politicians who want to initiate changes is to \u201cask questions\u201d rather than make suggestions, and Arostegui asked some very leading questions indeed in this closing address:\n\u201cWho discerns the existence or not of vital autonomy; is it the community or chosen people?\n\u201cAre there instances that work well within the Church which balance autonomy in a way that can be helpful in these situations?\n\u201cAt the time of St. Teresa she was an example of someone balanced.\nStability is one reason [for autonomy], but is stability understood in such a way that it can obstruct the spirit of mission and your availability to the Order and to the Church?\n\u201cThe valiant and prophetic initiative of Pope Pius XII to create Associations and Federations opened up contemplative life, though it was also thought that it could harm cloister and autonomy.\nCan such essential autonomy continue as it is?\n\u201c50 years ago there was stability.\nHow do we conceive today the relationship between autonomy and Federation-Association and between autonomy and Fr.\nGeneral?\n\u201cCould there be other forms of government?\u201d\nFollowing the Father General\u2019s address are notes from the language groups, including the following:\n\u201cWhile some communities do not want their autonomy to be touched, and have certain fears of \u2018external\u2019 interference, others want a more moderate and flexible autonomy that, without going to the Congregation would have a juridical form, where the President with her Council can intervene in extreme cases that today we watch with pain, our hands tied.\nThough we want these legal channels to be established, it must remain clear what the limits of the Federation Council are, in order to avoid abuses of power on the part of the same.\u201d \u201c...The absence of vital autonomy is also noticed when\u2026 the same person remains prioress for years.\u201d \u201c...We need criteria that expand number 203 of our Constitutions and clarify vital autonomy.\nWe perceive that there is a shortage of authority figures.\nWe do not want new figures but rather those that already exist (Associations, [federation] Presidents, Provincials...) be empowered in a legal way (canonically) to help communities in difficulty, for the mission to discern, to counsel, to accompany.\u201d \u201c...We are also concerned for those communities not affiliated to Federations, we see that we should be close to them.\u201d\nMaybe this summary document of 2009 can give us an idea what to expect from Rome in 2018, now that the \u201cprogressivist\u201d faction in the Vatican is in the ascendancy and is free to act without restriction.\nWhat comes clear comparing this document to Cor orans is that the Vatican\u2019s machinery has long been at work forcing a uniform and essentially bureaucratic, heavily authoritarian and legalistic vision of contemplative life on anyone who fails sufficiently to resist it.\nAnd with the statistics offered at this meeting we can see clearly where this road leads.\nSo many Catholics in the last 40 years assumed that under the \u201cconservatives\u201d John Paul II and Benedict XVI at least the Vatican was \u201conside.\u201d At least in Rome they understood the terrible threat of the Bolshie VaticanTwoist revolutionaries.\nBut this report of 2009 shows a clear picture of a Roman congregation determined to see the revolution through to its inevitable conclusion.\n_____________________\n[1] An aside that will perhaps be noteworthy to traditionalist readers is the little comment in the report on the difficulty of having a liturgical observance between all the disparate nations represented at the meeting.\n\u201cEucharist and Lauds in Spanish.\nFr.\nIsidore D\u2019Silva had prepared a booklet with the liturgy for each day.\nEach psalm was in a different language, and was prepared by the corresponding liturgical group.\nHowever, having the text in front of us made it easier to follow the recitation in other languages.\nThe end result was that we could all join in the liturgy.\nWe were all united in the praise of the Spirit who had brought us there together from different languages and nations.\u201d\n[2]

indoctrinating children with beliefs that conflict with parents\u2019 political, social, and even religious beliefs would motivate many families to homeschool.\nEven when government schools are not intentionally promoting cultural Marxism or other left-wing ideologies, they are still implicitly biased toward big government.\nFor example, how many government schools teach the Austrian economics

provides students with a well-rounded education that includes rigorous programs in history, mathematics, and the physical and natural sciences.\nThe curriculum also provides instruction in personal finance.\nStudents can develop superior oral and verbal communication skills via intensive writing and public speaking courses.\nAnother feature of my curriculum is that it provides students the opportunity to create and run their own internet businesses.\nThe government and history sections of the curriculum emphasize Austrian economics, libertarian political theory, and the history of liberty.\nHowever, unlike government schools, my curriculum never puts ideological indoctrination ahead of education.\nWhile government schools \u2014 and even many private schools \u2014 pretend religion played no significant role in history, my curriculum addresses the crucial role religion played in the development of Western civilization.\nHowever, the materials are drafted in such a way

"Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling,Labeling", "Slogans"]], ["Ex-Navy sailor pardoned by Trump says he's suing Comey and Obama\nA former Navy sailor who is one of five people to receive a pardon from President Donald Trump is planning to file a lawsuit against Obama administration officials, alleging that he was subject to unequal protection of the law.\nSpecifically, Kristian Saucier, who served a year in federal prison for taking photos of classified sections of the submarine on which he worked, argues that the same officials who meted out punishment to him for his actions chose to be lenient with Hillary Clinton in her use of a private email server and handling of classified information.\nHis lawyer, Ronald Daigle, told Fox News on Monday that the lawsuit, which he expects to file soon in Manhattan, will name the U.S. Department of Justice, former FBI Director James Comey and former President Barack Obama as defendants, among others.\n\u201cThey interpreted the law in my case to say it was criminal,\u201d Saucier told Fox News, referring to prosecuting authorities in his case, \u201cbut they didn\u2019t prosecute Hillary Clinton.\nHillary is still walking free.\nTwo guys on my ship did the same thing and weren\u2019t treated as criminals.\nWe want them to correct the wrong.\u201d\nDaigle said that a notice about the pending lawsuit was sent to the Department of Justice and others included in it in December.\nThere is usually a six-month period that must lapse before the lawsuit actually is filed.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll highlight the differences in the way Hillary Clinton was prosecuted and how my client was prosecuted,\u201d Daigle said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeking to cast a light on this to show that there\u2019s a two-tier justice system and we want it to be corrected.\u201d\nWhile campaigning, and after taking office, Trump frequently voiced support for Saucier, who in March became the second person he pardoned.\nTrump often compared the Obama administration\u2019s handling of Saucier\u2019s case with that of Clinton.\nSaucier, who lives in Vermont, pleaded guilty in 2016 to taking photos inside the USS Alexandria while it was stationed in Groton, Connecticut, in 2009.\nHe said he only wanted service mementos, but federal prosecutors argued he was a disgruntled sailor who had put national security at risk by taking photos showing the submarine's propulsion system and reactor compartment and then obstructed justice by destroying a laptop and camera.\nSaucier said that he recognized he had erred in taking the photos, which he said he wanted to show only to his family to show them where he worked.\nBut he lashed out at Obama officials, saying that his prosecution was politically motivated, prompted by sensitivity about classified information amid the scandal involving Clinton's emails.\n\u201cMy case was usually something handled by military courts,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThey used me as an example because of [the backlash over] Hillary Clinton.\u201d\nSaucier, 31, said that the pardon has enabled him to pick up the pieces and rebuild his life with his wife and young daughter.\nA felony conviction left him scrambling to find work; he finally landed a job collecting garbage.\nNow, he works on design and engineering projects for an industrial boiler company.\n\u201cThings are starting to go in the right direction,\u201d Saucier said.\n\u201cI work with a group of really great people, I get to use my skills set.\u201d\nBecause of the loss of income during his imprisonment, as well as earning below his potential when he collected garbage, he and his wife Sadie lost their home to foreclosure.\nDebt collectors called and his cars were repossessed.\n\u201cWith a pardon there\u2019s no magic wand that that gets waved and makes everything right,\u201d he said, \u201cBut I try to stay positive and look forward.\u201d\nHe praises the pardons that Trump has granted, and takes exception at the criticism.\n\u201cThe Obama administration singled out Dinesh for things most people don\u2019t even get charged for,\u201d Saucier said.\n\u201cPresident Trump noticed that my career was exemplary and that I didn\u2019t deserve what happened to me.\nConservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza, who was pardoned by Trump last week, had pleaded guilty to campaign finance fraud.\nTrump tweeted

Buchanan: Boehner's Right\u2014It's Trump's Party Now | Articles\nSee, earlier Trump Victorious As GOP Transformed Into A National Conservative Party by James Kirkpatrick, May 3, 2016\n\"There is no Republican Party.\nThere's a Trump party,\" John Boehner told a Mackinac, Michigan, gathering of the GOP faithful last week.\n\"The Republican Party is kind of taking a nap somewhere.\"\nEx-Speaker Boehner should probably re-check the old party's pulse, for the Bush-Boehner GOP may not just be napping.\nIt could be comatose.\nConsider.\nThat GOP was dedicated to free trade, open borders, amnesty and using U.S. power to punish aggressors and \"end tyranny in our world.\"\nThat GOP set out to create a new world order where dictatorships were threatened with \"regime change,\" and democratic capitalism was the new order of the ages.\nYet, Donald Trump captured the Republican nomination and won the presidency\u2014by saying goodbye to all that.\nHow probable is it that a future GOP presidential candidate will revive the Bush-Boehner agenda the party rejected in 2016, run on it, win, and impose it on the party and nation?\nBush-Boehner Republicanism appears to be as dead today as was Harding-Coolidge Republicanism after 1933.\nAnd if Trumpism is not the future of the GOP, it is hard to see what a promising GOP agenda might look like.\nA brief history: In seven elections starting in 1992, Republicans won the presidency three times, but the popular vote only once, in 2004, when George W. was still basking in his \"Mission Accomplished\" in Iraq.\nWhat fractured and overwhelmed the Bush-Boehner Republican Party?\nFirst, demography.\nThe mass immigration of Third World peoples that began with the 1965 immigration act, and the decline in the birth rate of native-born Americans, began to swamp the Nixon-Reagan New Majority.\nSecond, the collapse of the Soviet Empire and USSR removed the party's great unifying cause from Eisenhower to Bush I\u2014the Cold War.\nAfter the Red Army went home, \"America First\" had a new appeal!\nThird, faithful to the free trade cult in which they were raised, Republicans championed NAFTA, the WTO, and MFN for China.\nHistorians will look back in amazement at how America's free trade zealots gave away the greatest manufacturing base the world had ever seen, as they quoted approvingly 18th- and 19th-century scribblers whose ideas had done so much to bring down their own country, Great Britain.\nBetween 1997 and 2017, the EU ran up, at America's expense, trade surpluses in goods in excess of $2 trillion, while we also picked up the bill for Europe's defense.\nBetween 1992 and 2016, China was allowed to run $4 trillion in trade surpluses at our expense, converting herself into the world's first manufacturing power and denuding America of tens of thousands of factories and millions of manufacturing jobs.\nIn Trump's first year, China's trade surplus with the United States hit $375 billion.\nFrom January to March of this year, our trade deficit with China was running at close to the same astronomical rate.\n\"Trade deficits do not matter,\" we hear from the economists.\nThey might explain that to Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\nAnd perhaps someone can explain the wisdom of handing 4 percent of our GDP each year to an adversary nation, as U.S. admirals talk tough about confronting that adversary nation over islets and reefs in the South China Sea.\nWhy are we enriching and empowering so exorbitantly those whom we are told we may have to fight?\nFourth, under Bush II and Obama, the U.S. intervened massively in the Near and Middle East\u2014in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen.\nAnd the forces that pushed up into those conflicts, and so disillusioned the nation that it elected Barack Obama, are back, pushing for a new war, on Iran.\nThey may get this war, too.\nYet, given the anti-interventionist and anti-war stance of Trump's winning campaign, and of the Bernie Sanders campaign, U.S. involvement in Middle East wars seems less America's future than it does her past.\nAfter his 16 months in office, it appears as though the Trump presidency, no matter how brief, is going to be a watershed moment in U.S. and world history, and in the future of the GOP.\nThe world is changing.\nNATO and the EU are showing their age.\nNationalism, populism and tribalism are pervasive on the Old Continent.\nAnd America's willingness to bear the burden of Europe's defense, as they ride virtually free, is visibly waning.\nIt is hard to see why or how Republicans are ever again going to be the Bush-Boehner party that preceded the rise of Trump.\nWhat would be the argument for returning to a repudiated platform?\nTrump not only defeated 16 Bush Republicans, he presented an agenda on immigration, border security, amnesty, intervention abroad, the Middle East, NAFTA, free trade, Putin and Russia that was a rejection of what the Bush-Boehner Party had stood for and what its presidential candidates in 2008 and 2012, John McCain and Mitt Romney, had run on.\nIf the Republican Party is \"napping,\" let it slumber on, undisturbed, for its

Buchanan: Sorry, Jeff Flake, It's Trump's Party Now!\n| Articles\nMore is now required of us than to put down our thoughts in writing, declaimed Jeff Flake in his oration against President Trump, just before he announced he will be quitting the Senate.\nThough he had lifted the title of his August anti-Trump polemic, \"Conscience of a Conservative,\" from Barry Goldwater, Jeff Flake is no Barry Goldwater.\nGoldwater took on the GOP establishment in the primaries, voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, defiantly declared, \"Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice,\" and then went down to defeat battling to the end after the assassination of JFK made LBJ invincible.\nThe real \"Mr. Conservative\" was a true profile in courage.\nFlake, with only 18 percent approval in Arizona, decided to pack it in rather than get waxed in his own primary.\nWith Falstaff, Flake appears to believe that \"discretion is the better part of valor.\"\nSen. Bob Corker is another summertime soldier calling on colleagues to stand and fight Trump while he retires to Tennessee.\nIt's no wonder the establishment is viewed with such derision.\nFlake calls Trump \"dangerous to our democracy.\"\nBut the real threat Trump represents is to the GOP establishment's control of the party's agenda and the party's destiny.\nU.S. politics have indeed been coarsened, with Trump playing a lead role.\nYet, beneath the savagery of the uncivil war in the party lies more than personal insults and personality clashes.\nThis is a struggle about policy, about the future.\nAnd Trump is president because he read the party and the country right, while the Bush-McCain Republican establishment had lost touch with both.\nHow could the Beltway GOP not see that its defining policies \u2014 open borders, amnesty, free trade globalism, compulsive military intervention in foreign lands for ideological ends \u2014 were alienating its coalition?\nWhat had a quarter century of Bushite free trade produced?\nAbout $12 trillion in trade deficits, $4 trillion with China alone, a loss of 55,000 plants and 6 million manufacturing jobs.\nWe imported goods \"Made in China,\" while exporting our future.\nU.S. elites made China great again, to where Beijing is now challenging our strategic position and presence in Asia.\nCould Republicans not see the factories shutting down, or not understand why workers' wages had failed to rise for decades?\nWhat did the democracy crusades \"to end tyranny in our world\" accomplish?\nThousands of U.S. dead, tens of thousands of wounded, trillions of dollars sunk, and a Mideast awash in blood from Afghanistan to Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen, with millions uprooted and homeless.\nYet, still, the GOP establishment has not repudiated the mindset that produced this.\nWith the Cold War over for a quarter of a century, what is the case now for America, $20 trillion in debt, going abroad in search of monsters to destroy?\nConsider.\nBush-Obama \"open borders\" brought in tens of millions of Third World peoples, legally and illegally, to rising resistance from Americans forced to bear the economic and social costs.\nWhat was the GOP establishment's reply to the opposition to amnesty for illegals and calls for a moratorium on legal immigration, to assimilate the tens of millions already here?\nTo call them nativists and parade their moral superiority.\nFlake and Corker are being beatified by the Beltway elites, and George W. Bush and John McCain celebrated for their denunciations of Trumpism.\nYet no two people are more responsible for the blunders of the post-Cold War era than McCain and Bush.\nAbout which of half a dozen wars were they right?\nYesterday's New York Times recognized Trump's triumph:\n\"Despite the fervor of President Trump's Republican opponents, the president's brand of hard-edged nationalism\u2014with its gut-level cultural appeals and hard lines on trade and immigration\u2014is taking root within his adopted party.\"\nMoreover, a new question arises:\nCan the GOP establishment believe that if Trump falls, or they bring him down, they will inherit the estate and be welcomed home like the Prodigal Son?\nDo they believe their old agenda of open borders, amnesty, free trade globalism and democracy-crusading can become America's agenda again?\nTrumpism is not a detour, after which we can all get back on the interstate to the New World Order.\nFor though unpleasant, it is not unfair to say that if there was one desire common to Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz and Donald Trump voters, it was be rid of the regime resting on top of all of us.\nShould Trump fall, and a restored establishment attempt to reimpose the old policies, there will be a truly uncivil war in this country.\nAfter the Trumpian revolt, there is no going back.\nAs that most American of writers, Thomas Wolfe, put it, \"You can't go home again.\"\nTraditionalists have been told that for years.\nNow it's the turn of the GOP establishment to learn the truth as well.\nGoldwater lost badly, but the establishment that abandoned him never had its patrimony restored.\nIt was the leaders they abhorred, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, to whom the future belonged.\nPatrick J.

Clinton\u2019s emails.\nAccording to Fox News, Saucier argues that the same officials who sought out punishment to Saucier for his actions chose to be lenient with Hillary Clinton in her use of a private email server and mishandling of classified information.\nSaucier\u2019s lawyer, Ronald Daigle, told Fox News on Monday that the lawsuit, which he expects to file soon in Manhattan, will name the U.S. Department of Justice, former FBI Director James Comey and former President Barack Obama as defendants, among others.\nSaucier, who lives in Vermont, pleaded guilty in 2016 to taking photos inside the USS Alexandria while it was stationed in Groton, Connecticut, in 2009.\nHe said he only wanted service mementos, but federal prosecutors argued he was a disgruntled sailor who had put

Jobs\u2014TRUMP EFFECT!\nAmerican Worker Displacement, Immigrant Population, Black Unemployment ALL DECLINE!\n| Articles\n)\nForget the Wolff book brouhaha and Trump\u2019s latest DACA dalliance \u2014the real story is outside the Beltway , where real people live and work.\nDecember marked the fifth month in a row in which the immigrant working-age population ( legal and illegal declined from the same month of the prior year.\nSimultaneously, immigrant displacement of American workers fell, also apparently confirming a trend that began in September.\nAnd, by the way, black unemployment is at a record low.\nWhat started after the 2016 election as a reduction in the rate of increase in the foreign-born population of working age has turned into an outright retreat.\nThis is in dramatic contrast to the last months of the Obama Regime, which saw year-over-year increases in immigrant working-age population far in excess of the estimated 1 million legal immigrants admitted annually, and which I argued meant that an unreported illegal alien surge was underway.\nAccording to the Labor Department employment report released last Friday, December there were 77,000 fewer working-age immigrants (legal and illegal) in the country in December 2017 than in December 2016\u2014a decline of 0.18%.\nThis follows year-over-year drops of 138,000 in August, 143,000 in September, and 117,000 in October, and 64,000 in November.\nNot since the Great Recession has the foreign-born working-age population declined for five consecutive months\u2014but now, in telling contrast, the economy is expanding.\nThis makes the Trump Era immigrant workforce decline especially striking.\nNote that this is a net figure.\nThe year-over- year reduction in the immigrant working-age population does not mean new immigrants have stopped coming in.\nAbout 300,000 immigrants die annually, and an equal number leave (voluntarily or otherwise), according to a study by the Center for Immigration Studies.\n[U.S.\nImmigrant Population Hit Record 43.7 Million in 2016, By Steven A. Camarota and Karen Zeigler,October 16, 2017] So the 77,000 reduction in working-age immigrants from December 2016 to December 2017 is consistent with a gross inflow of about 500,000 new foreign-born workers (legal and illegal) over that period\u2014the gross inflow more than offset by the gross reduction of 600,000 due to deaths, deportations, and immigrant emigrants.\nThis helps explain why a reduction in the immigrant workforce population reduction is compatible with reports of a recent increase in illegal immigration on the U.S. southwest border (albeit still less than at the end of the Obama Regime).\nThe additional good news: Native-born American workers took all the jobs created this month, according to the Household Survey, which records workers\u2019 immigrant status (but not their legal status).\nThe Household Survey reported 103,000 jobs were created last month\u2014well below the 148,000 figure found by the far more widely-cited Payroll Survey.\nIn December 2017:\nImmigrant employment fell by 246,000, down by 0.93%\nNative-born American employment rose a whopping 349,000 \u2013 up 0.27%\nThe immigrant employment index, set to 100.0 in January 2009, fell from 122.0 to 120.9.\nThe native-born American employment index rose from 105.8 to 106.0..\nThe New VDARE American Worker Displacement Index (NVDAWDI), our term for the ratio of immigrant to native-born employment growth indexes, fell fromto(100X (120.9/106.0))\nTrump may not have delivered (yet) on his promise to bring back the factory and coal jobs so many of his supporters lost during the Obama years.\nBut by shrinking the pool of immigrants willing to do that work, he has put more money in pockets of his voters.\nWhile overall wage growth remains modest \u2013 2.5% per annum in December \u2013 Blue collar workers have beat this by a wide margin:\n\u201cIt is commonly said that wage stagnation contributed to an economic anxiety in middle America that carried Donald Trump into the White House\u2026Yet Mr. Trump\u2019s rise seems to have coincided with a turnaround in fortunes for the middle class.\n\u2026 The latest development\u2014one that will be of particular interest to Mr. Trump\u2014is that blue-collar wages have begun to rocket.\n\u2026In the year [2017] to the third quarter, wage and salary growth for the likes of factory workers, builders and drivers easily outstripped that for professionals and managers.\nIn some cases, blue-collar pay growth now exceeds 4%\u2026\u201d Blue-collar wages are surging.\nCan it last?, The Economist, Magazine, November 14th 2017\nEleven months of Trump has not come close to undoing the damage done by eight years of Obama.\nNative-born American workers lost ground to their foreign-born competitors throughout the Obama years and this trend accelerated significantly in the months leading up to the election:\nCan't render, error\nNative-born American employment growth is represented by the black line, immigrant employment growth is in pink, and NVAWDI\u2014the ratio of immigrant to native-born American job growth\u2014is in blue.\nAnother way of looking at American worker displacement: the immigrant share of total U.S. employment rose steadily, albeit erratically, throughout the Obama years.\nIt fell sharply in the months after the 2016 election, but roared back to Obama-era levels in the spring.\nImmigrants held 16.99% of total jobs in December, a significant drop from November\u2019s 17.16% share.\nCan't render, error\nA detailed snapshot of American worker displacement over the past year is available in the Employment Status of the Civilian Population by Nativity table published in the monthly BLS Report.\nOver the last 12 months (December 2016 to December 2017):\nThe native-born American labor force (employed plus looking for work) grew twice as fast as the immigrant labor force: 0.63% versus 0.30%.\nADVANTAGE AMERICANS\nas the immigrant labor force: 0.63% versus 0.30%.\nAmerican employment grew 57% faster than immigrant employment: 1.27% versus 0.81%.\nADVANTAGE AMERICANS\nThe labor-force participation rate (LPR), a sign of worker confidence and mobility, rose by 0.6 points for immigrants and was unchanged for native-born Americans.\nAt 65.3%, the immigrant LPR this December was considerably above the native-born American rate (61.9%.)\nADVANTAGE IMMIGRANTS\nThe number of unemployed Americans fell by 763,000\u2014down 12.7%, while the number of unemployed immigrants fell 129,000\u2014down by 11%.\nADVANTAGE AMERICANS\nAnother piece of good news, quite possibly connected to the shrinking of the immigrant working age population, caught our eye: The unemployment rate for black Americans fell to 6.8% in December , the lowest level since the Labor Department began tracking the figure in 1972.\n[ U.S. economy added 2 million jobs in 2017 , by Patrick Gillespie, CNNMoney, January 5, 2018]\nBy removing foreign competitors, Trump may have done more for blacks in 11 months than Obama did in eight years.\nOf course, this could be affected by statistical noise\u2014and it could be undone by e.g.\na DACA capitulation.\nBut right now it increasingly appears the Trump Effect is real\u2014and achieved entirely through enhanced enforcement.\nWhat could happen if the GOP-controlled Congress woke up and enacted an immigration

additionally, it actually mentions ethnicity.\nIn May, according to the Household Survey, total employment rose by 105,000.\nNon-Hispanics actually gained ground:\nTotal employment: up 105,000 (+0.08 percent)\nNon-Hispanic employment: up 190,000 (+0.16 percent)\nHispanic employment: down 85,000 (-0.42 percent)\nThus VDAWDI\u2014VDARE.com's American Worker Displacement Index, unveiled in 2004 and still unique\u2014fell to 126.2 in May from April's 127.0 level.\nThis, of course, is atypical statistical noise.\nNon-Hispanics have lost jobs at twice the rate of Hispanics since the recession hit in December 2007.\nAnd since the official start of the \"recovery\" in June 2009, Hispanics have gained 416,000 jobs while non-Hispanics have lost 675,000 positions.\nStep back further and the picture is still bleaker.\nSince January 2001 the number of non-Hispanics holding jobs has declined by 1.9 million, or by -1.6%.\nOver that same period Hispanic employment rose by 3.9 million, up a whopping 24.2%.\nSimply put, the 21st century has not been good for non-Hispanic job seekers.\nThis Hispanic/non-Hispanic divide was, of course, a convenient proxy for VDARE.com's primary interest: foreign-born workers and their role in displacing their native-born counterparts.\nWe tracked this by looking at Hispanics because such a high proportion of them are foreign-born\u2014and because the federal government declined to provide data on immigrant vs. non-immigrant unemployment.\nHowever, since January 2010, the Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS] has begun to publish figures for foreign-born and native-born employment.\nThese data are not seasonally adjusted, making month to month trends difficult to interpret.\nBLS resolves the dilemma by comparing the current month with the same month of the prior year:\nBy this measure also, May 2011 is notable for some catching up on the part of native-born workers\u2014at least when compared to the same month of 2010:\nEmployment Status by Nativity, May 2010-May 2011 (numbers in 1000s;

Congress that Iran would remain barred from the U.S. financial system \u2014 secretly mobilized to give Tehran access to American banks to convert the windfall of cash it received from sanctions relief under the 2015 nuclear deal into dollars, an investigative report by the Senate has revealed.\nA copy of the report, obtained by The Washington Times, outlines how Obama-era State and Treasury Department officials discreetly issued a special license for the conversion to a major Omani bank and unsuccessfully pressured two U.S. banks to partake in the transaction, all while misleading lawmakers about the activities.\nThe document, compiled by the Senate\u2019s Republican-led chief investigative subcommittee, began circulating Tuesday, just as the Trump administration issued its harshest warnings to date to foreign governments and companies to avoid doing business with Iran or find themselves in the crosshairs of Washington\u2019s reimposition of sanctions as part of Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the nuclear deal.\n\u201cCompanies doing business in Iran face substantial risks, and those risks are even greater as we reimpose nuclear-related sanctions,\u201d said Sigal Mandelker, Treasury Department undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.\nShe also called on foreign governments to harden their financial systems against \u201cdeceptive\u201d Iranian transactions that ultimately channel money to terrorists.\nThe Iranian government \u201cuses shell and front companies to conceal its tracks\u201d as part of an elaborate scheme designed to procure cash for the Quds Force of Iran\u2019s militant Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the U.S. designates as a terrorist organization, Ms. Mandelker said.\nShe issued the warnings in a speech at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank as Iran announced Tuesday that it was formally moving ahead with preparations to increase its nuclear enrichment capacities \u2014 the sharpest response to date by the Islamic republic to Mr. Trump\u2019s pullout from the nuclear accord.\nIranian officials said the increase, while provocative, does not violate its commitments under the nuclear accord.\nThe president sent shock waves around the world with his May 8 decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear pact and begin reimposing U.S. sanctions, which the U.S., Europe, China and Russia had collectively lifted in 2015 in exchange for Iran\u2019s promise to curb its suspect nuclear programs and allow international inspections.\nWhile Iran told the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency on Tuesday that it plans only to increase enrichment within limits set by 2015 deal, the announcement came with threats from a top Iranian official that the activities could be quickly expanded.\nThe warning put fresh pressure on European leaders to keep the nuclear accord alive despite Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal.\nThe head of Iran\u2019s nuclear agency, Ali Akbar Salehi, said Tehran is prepared to dramatically increase its capacity for enrichment but that the work so far is limited to building a facility for assembling the centrifuges.\nHe made the comment a day after Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ordered the increase in capacity and vowed that Iran would preserve its nuclear program despite the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 accord.\nThe Senate report focuses new scrutiny on the lengths President Obama\u2019s team was willing to go to ensure the deal\u2019s success as it was still being negotiated.\nThe Senate Homeland Security Committee\u2019s permanent subcommittee on investigations probe contends that the Obama administration went out of its way to keep U.S. lawmakers in the dark about calculated and secretive efforts to give Tehran a back channel to the international financial system and to U.S. banks, facilitating a massive U.S. currency conversion worth billions of dollars.\n\u201cSenior U.S. government officials repeatedly testified to Congress that Iranian access to the U.S. financial system was not on the table or part of any deal,\u201d according to a draft copy of the document obtained by The Times.\n\u201cDespite these claims, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, at the direction of the U.S. State Department, granted a specific license that authorized a conversion of Iranian assets worth billions of U.S. dollars using the U.S. financial system.\n\u201cEven after the specific license was issued, U.S. government officials maintained in congressional testimony that Iran would not be granted access to the U.S. financial system,\u201d the report said.\nSen.\nRob Portman, the Ohio Republican who chairs the subcommittee, is set to outline his panel\u2019s findings Wednesday.\nUnder terms of the nuclear deal, Iran was given the right to reclaim billions of dollars in state assets and bank accounts frozen by international sanctions, but it remained \u201cillegal for U.S. persons, entities, and financial institutions to do business with Iran or parties on behalf of Iran.\u201d\nThe ban included any \u201cintermediary\u201d transactions by U.S. banks to convert currency for Iran \u2014 a development that would have elevated the value of the Iranian assets on the global market and allowed Tehran to more easily move the money through the international banking system.\nOn the day the nuclear deal was implemented in 2015, Tehran had some $5.7 billion worth of assets at Bank Muscat in Muscat, Oman, according to Senate investigators, who said Tehran moved quickly to request access to the U.S. dollar.\nOn Tehran\u2019s request, Bank Muscat contacted the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s office of foreign assets control.\nAccording to the Senate report: \u201cMuscat sought to convert $5.7 billion in Omai rials into euros.\n[But] because the rial is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the most efficient conversion was with an intermediary step through a U.S. bank using U.S. dollars.\u201d\nObama Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July 2015 that Iran would \u201ccontinue to be denied access to the [U.S.] financial and commercial market\u201d under the proposed accord, but the Treasury office went ahead with attempts to quietly allow the currency transaction sought by Iran.\n\u201cOn February 24, 2016, OFAC issued a specific license to Bank Muscat authorizing Iranian assets worth roughly $5.7 billion to flow through the U.S. financial system,\u201d according to the Senate report, which claims the move was made \u201ceven though U.S. sanctions prohibited it.\u201d\nEven as office of foreign assets control officials directly \u201cencouraged two U.S. correspondent banks to convert the funds,\u201d the Treasury Department continued to deny it was working to facilitate the currency transaction, said the report, which cites a 2016 letter from the department to Sen. Marco Rubio, Florida Republican, and Sen. Mark Kirk, Illinois Republican, that contended the Obama \u201cadministration has not been and is not planning to grant Iran access to the U.S. financial system.\u201d\nThe catch, according to Senate investigators, was that neither of the U.S. banks approached by the office of foreign assets control would take on the Iranian currency exchange \u2014 in part because of political concerns over the prospect of being found out to have secretly circumvented the remaining ban on U.S. transactions with the Islamic republic.\nDespite the Obama administration\u2019s efforts, Iran was ultimately forced to convert its Bank Muscat assets to euros in small increments using European banks and without accessing the U.S. financial system, the Senate investigators said.\nMr. Portman said in a statement Tuesday night that \u201cthe Obama administration misled the American people and Congress because they were desperate to get a deal with Iran.\u201d\n\u201cDespite claims both before and after the Iran deal was completed that the U.S. financial system would remain off limits, the Obama administration issued a specific license allowing Iran to convert billions of dollars in assets using the U.S. financial system,\u201d Mr. Portman said.\n\u201cThe only reason this transaction wasn\u2019t executed was because two U.S. banks refused, even though the administration asked them to help convert the money.\u201d\nSuch sanctions, he added, \u201care a vital foreign policy tool, and the U.S. government should never work to actively undermine their enforcement or effectiveness.\u201d\n", ["Repetition", "Appeal_to_fear-prejudice", "Exaggeration,Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling,Labeling", "Flag-Waving"]], ["Spygate Coverup?\nhttps://www.lewrockwell.com/lrc-blog/spygate-coverup/\nRep.

system \"were absolutely false,\" that the license was \"totally in line with our well-known obligations under the deal.\"\nThat source pointed out that the license \"did not authorize Iran to conduct commercial transactions denominated in US dollars.\nIt did not allow Iran to conduct commercial transactions in foreign currencies via the US banking system.\nIt did not allow Iranian parties to open accounts or correspondent accounts at US banks.\nIt did not allow Iran to send funds to the US or receive funds from the US.\nAnd it did not allow Iran access to US investments or markets.\"\nThe GOP

we all know why that is.\nIt's because it implicates dozens of House Democrats in what could be the biggest crime of spying in US history by Muslim IT spy Imran Awan and his partners.\nFormer head of the Democratic National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz is on the front line of aiding and abetting Awan and his associates as has been revealed by Luke Rosiak of The Daily Caller.\nIn a lengthy report by Rosiak at The Daily Caller News Foundation, he writes:\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you consider to be

involving her then\u2013IT aide Imran Awan, according to two House employees.\nThe dispute came after Awan\u2019s father was charged with fraud in relation to the deal, and the mysterious exertion of political influence resulted in Pakistani authorities instead targeting the elderly alleged victims, according to a local report.\nAnd when a House Office of Inspector General cybersecurity investigation found that Awan made \u201cunauthorized access\u201d to House servers, including the House Democratic Caucus\u2019 shortly before the election, Wasserman Schultz became \u201cfrantic, not normal,\u201d \u201cmaking the rounds\u201d to House officials in an attempt to kill the investigation, one House employee told The Daily Caller News Foundation.\nAwan told people Wasserman Schultz chose the name for his daughter, Leza \u2014 a Jewish name \u2014 and that the Florida congresswoman\u2019s daughter regularly rode a horse that Awan kept at a boarding facility, sources with knowledge of the relationship told TheDCNF.\nWasserman Schultz cornered House Chief Administrative Officer Phil Kiko and called him a \u201cfucking Islamophobe,\u201d saying \u201cyou will not so much as take away their parking spots,\u201d the two House employees said Kiko told them.\nThe congresswoman also told Kiko she had invited Awan\u2019s whole family to her daughter\u2019s bat mitzvah and said she had \u201chelped him with a land deal,\u201d the sources said.\nA spokesman for Kiko declined to comment on this story.\nA 2009 article in the Pakistani publication Dawn, headlined \u201cInfluential expat shields father from long arm of law,\u201d said Awan\u2019s father was facing criminal fraud charges involving a land deal, but Awan used political connections to pressure the police into targeting the alleged victims instead.\nAwan\u2019s father purchased \u201chuge chunks of land from different farmers in 2008,\u201d but all the checks bounced, the report said.\n\u201cThe police high-ups are \u2018ominously\u2019 indifferent to proceed against Awan,\u201d and it\u2019s \u201cnoteworthy\u201d how they were \u201ccomplying with the desires of\u201d Awan, who the paper described as a \u201cWhite House employee.\u201d\n\u201cAbout a dozen farmers of Chak 7-JB, Panjor, including five siblings \u2014 all aged between 57 and 70 \u2014 have given up hope of justice after they sold their agricultural lands to Ashraf Awan of Bole De Jhugi, who is father of White House employee Shahid Imran,\u201d Dawn reported.\nImran Awan also goes by Shahid Imran Awan, Virginia court records show.\nThe police harassed the 19 would-be victims, including the five elderly brothers and even their lawyer, and charged them with \u201cfrivolous\u201d cases, apparently to get them to stop trying to get the money they say they were owed, the paper said.\n\u201cMohammad Abid, a victim of [Ashraf] Awan\u2019s alleged high-profile swindling, said that [Ashraf] Awan\u2019s son had easy access to the corridors of power and that\u2019s why he was able to [pressure] the police to dance to his tunes,\u201d Dawn reported.\nThe article details a series of people who say they were then subject to retaliation, including widow Bushra Bibi who said, \u201cnow Imran was threatening her with dire consequences.\u201d\nA third source, who\u2019s familiar with Imran Awan, told TheDCNF that Awan recounted the intervention in the foreign criminal matter and that Awan said it was Wasserman Schultz who intervened.\nA fourth source \u2014 a fellow House IT aide \u2014 previously told TheDCNF that Awan said now-Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel wasinvolved.\nDr. Zafar Iqbal, one of the alleged victims, told TheDCNF that \u201cImran came to Pakistan to get [his father] out of jail, since he had some [connections] in the Congress.\u201d\nAshraf Awan\u2019s business partner in the land deal, Rashid Minhas, told TheDCNF that the elder Awan gave a USB to a Pakistani senator who is a former head of a Pakistani intelligence agency, and that Imran claimed his IT position in Congress gave him the power to \u201cchange the U.S. president.\u201d Minhas is in prison for an unrelated fraud charge.\nOn July 25, 2016, the House Inspector General notified the Committee on House Administration that investigators had detected major cybersecurity violations by the Awan family.\nAwan, his wife, two brothers, his brother\u2019s wife, and even his elderly father were all being paid by various Democrats to manage their servers, with many of the members from Wasserman Schultz\u2019s Florida.\nThe finding came at a critical time for Democrats: It was three days after WikiLeaks published the first emails from a hacked on the DNC, setting the stage for Wasserman Schultz to lose her position as party chair and for Democrats to begin electioneering on a theme of Russian hacking.\nIn February 2017, Kiko and the House\u2019s top law enforcement official, Paul Irving, outlined serious violations in a letter to the committee, and the family was banned from the House computer network.\nThe letter also noted that the House Democratic Caucus server disappeared soon after the IG report named it as key evidence.\nBut Wasserman Schultz refused to fire Awan, with her spokesman saying he would work on \u201cwebsites\u201d and \u201cprinters,\u201d which a cybersecurity expert previously told TheDCNF would presumably involve network access.\nThe congresswoman also added Awan\u2019s wife, Hina Alvi, to her payroll in late 2016, after the investigation was in full swing, but before the family was banned from the network.\nWasserman Schultz kept paying her until March 17 \u2014 12 days after Alvi went to Pakistan with $12,000 in a suitcase.\nHer actions so rattled the Administration Committee\u2019s Democratic staff director, Jamie Fleet, that he planted a negative story in Politico that revealed Wasserman Schultz, his fellow Democrat, was continuing to pay the suspect, two House sources said.\nThe story also said Wasserman Schultz had a \u201cfriendly personal relationship\u201d with Awan and Alvi.\nFleet did not respond to a request for comment.\nKiko said in an April 2018 hearing spurred by the scandal that he was powerless to stop members who refused to fire a bad actor.\n\u201cTermination, now it\u2019s the member\u2019s responsibility \u2026 We can revoke everything but they could still be employed,\u201d he said.\nHe added that his office should have the authority to override members who would want to keep a rule-breaker on the government network.\nWasserman Schultz became fixated on finding out everything investigators knew about Awan, the House sources said.\nHouse investigators briefed her extensively with significant evidence about Awan and his family, including improper computer evidence.\nYet Wasserman Schultz said in a statement, \u201cmy office was provided no evidence to indicate that laws had been broken, which over time, raised troubling concerns about due process, fair treatment and potential ethnic and religious profiling.\u201d\nWasserman Schultz was defending someone investigators allegedly told her was suspected of cybersecurity violations, despite having resigned from her position as DNC head following a devastating hack during the 2016 election.\nDespite Wasserman Schultz\u2019s relationship with Awan, in April 2017 \u2014 two months after he was banned from the computer network \u2014 the IT aide appeared to put the congresswoman at risk.\nCapitol Police found a laptop with the username RepDWS in a phone booth at midnight along with a copy of Awan\u2019s ID, a letter to prosecutors and a note that said \u201cattorney client privilege,\u201d according to a police report.\nAwan\u2019s ID caused police to tie it to a criminal suspect and seize it, but the note kept them from looking at it.\nThat led to a tense exchange recorded on video in May 2017, in which Wasserman Schultz threatened the chief of the Capitol Police with \u201cconsequences\u201d for not returning the laptop.\nWhen he refused, she mulled attempting to restructuring the Capitol Police\u2019s entire board so that her committee would have more leverage over it.\nHouse sources told TheDCNF these exchanges were only a public glimpse into numerous such interactions, which were frequently profane, with every official she could buttonhole.\nOne source said she also went to the Department of Justice and \u201cmade a stink.\u201d\nWasserman Schultz hired the House\u2019s former top lawyer, Bill Pittard \u2014 who had recently quit the House \u2014 to try to block prosecutors from seeing evidence, TheDCNF previously reported.Awan obtained legal representation from two lawyers who began their careers in Miami \u2014 one with experience in espionage cases and the other a former aide to Hillary Clinton.\nWasserman Schultz\u2019 district includes much of Miami.\nOne of Awan\u2019s lawyers told a judge he felt \u201cvery strongly\u201d that prosecutors should not be able to look at the RepDWS laptop, mounting an attorney-client privilege argument.\nProsecutors did not challenge the argument before the judge.\nIn August 2017, Imran and Hina were charged with four felony counts for gathering up money under allegedly false circumstances before wiring $300,000 to Pakistan in January.\nProsecutors said the timing suggests that the Awans had learned of their investigation, which a spokeswoman for Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, AshLee Strong, told TheDCNF was supposed to be secret.\nCapitol Police \u201crequested that the shared employees be allowed to continue to use their IT credentials until February [2017] because they didn\u2019t want to tip off the employees,\u201d she said.\nWasserman Schultz\u2019s brother is a prosecutor in the same office handling the case and has tweeted about it.\nGowen said the wire transfer instead had to do with the land deal, which he told the Washington Examiner was \u201cquickly souring.\u201d\nWasserman Schultz did not respond to a request for comment.\n", ["Doubt", "Exaggeration,Minimisation", "Loaded_Language",

Jimmy Carter, who made the Islamic Republic of Iran possible, thought that money, which had been paid by the Shah\u2019s government in a canceled arms deal, belonged to the mullahs who overthrew the Shah.\nLikewise Reagan, George H.

Ray, who heads up the National Home Education Research Institute, in Salem, Oregon, who\u2019s conducted homeschooling research for 33 years, told The Times that concern over school curriculum has reached the top of the charts for most parents.\nRay said the top three reasons that parents choose homeschooling are a desire to provide religious instruction or different values than those offered in public schools; dissatisfaction with the academic curriculum, and worries about the school environment.\nSince teachers are not allowed to arm themselves to defend their students against the violence often perpetrated at schools simply because they are gun free zones, homeschooling takes care of that problem.\n\u201cMost parents homeschool for more than one reason,\u201d Ray told the paper.\n\u201cBut when we ask families why do they homeschool, near the top nowadays is concern about the environment of schools, and that includes safety, pressure to get into drugs, pressure to get into sexual activity.\nIt includes all of that.\u201d\nIndoctrination means to teach a person to accept a belief uncritically.\nIt\u2019s the very reason the governments of the world still exist.\nPeople cannot logically and critically understand that hurting people and taking their things is wrong \u2013 even if people who declare themselves government is the one doing it.\nGovernments are nothing more than a handful of people and have no right to aggress against others.\nBut humans are taught at a young age to never question this and that belief has kept most of humanity enslaved for centuries.\n\ufeff\nIt isn\u2019t a surprise that so many have decided to educate their children themselves.\nAnd as schools continue to fail, and authoritarian policies continue to wreak havoc on

journalists and, unable to find work, he eventually committed suicide.\nThe CIA Inspector General subsequently vindicated him.\nNow, Julian Assange is a long way from taking his own life.\nHis resilience is remarkable.\nBut he is still a human being and he has taken such a battering.\nProbably the hardest thing for him to take is the utter hypocrisy of news organizations\u2014like The New York Times, which published the WikiLeaks \u201cWar Logs\u201d and \u201cCablegate,\u201d The Washington Post and The Guardian, which has taken a vindictive delight in tormenting Julian.\nThe Guardian a few years ago got a Pulitzer Prize writing about Snowden.\nBut their coverage of Snowden left him in Hong Kong.\nIt was WikiLeaks that got Snowden out of Hong Kong and to safety.\nProfessionally, I find this one of the most unsavory and immoral things I have seen in my career.\nThe persecution of this man by huge media organizations which have drawn great benefit from WikiLeaks.\nOne of Assange\u2019s great tormentors, The Guardian\u2018s Luke Harding, made a great deal of money with a Hollywood version of a book that he and David Lee wrote in which they basically attacked their source.\nI suppose you have to be a psychiatrist to understand all of this.\nMy understanding is that so many of these journalists are shamed.\nThey realize that WikiLeaks has done what they should have done a long time ago, and that is to tell us how governments lie.\nDB: One thing that disturbs me greatly is the way in which the Western corporate press speculate about Russian involvement in the U.S. 2016 election, that it was a hack through Julian Assange.\nAny serious investigator would want to know who would be motivated.\nAnd yet the possibility that it might be the dozen or so pissed-off people who went to work for the Clinton machine and learned from the inside that the DNC was all about getting rid of Bernie Sanders\u2026this is not a part of the story!\nEight Hundred Thousand Disclosures on Russia\nJP: What happened to Sanders and the way that he was rolled by the Clinton organization, everybody knows that this is the story.\nAnd now we have the DNC suing WikiLeaks!\nThere\u2019s a kind of farcical element to this.\nI mean, none of this came from the Russians.\nThat WikiLeaks is somehow in bed with the Russians is ludicrous.\nWikiLeaks published about 800,000 major disclosures about Russia, some of them extremely critical of the Russian government.\nIf you are a government and you are doing something untoward or you are lying to your people and WikiLeaks gets the documents to show it, they will publish no matter who you are, be they the United States or Russia.\nDB: Randy Credico, because of his work and his decision to devote a very high-profile series to the persecution of Julian Assange, recently found himself under attack.\nHe went to the White House Press Roast and, after having a nice discussion with Congressman Schiff, he yelled out \u201cWhat about Julian Assange?\u201d The room was packed full of reporters but Randy was attacked and dragged out.\nIt was if everyone there was embarrassed to recognize that one of their brethren was being brutalized.\nJP: Randy shouted some truth.\nIt is very similar to what happened to Ray McGovern.\nRay is a former member of the CIA but extremely principled.\nI might suggest he is a renegade now.\nDB: It was hysterical to watch these four armed guards who kept shouting \u201cStop resisting, stop resisting!\u201d and they are beating the hell out of him!\nJP: I thought the image of Ray being hauled off was particularly telling.\nThese four overweight, obviously ill-trained young men manhandling Ray, who is 78 years old.\nThere was something highly emblematic about that for me.\nHe stood up to challenge the fact that the CIA was about to hand over leadership to a person who had been in charge of torture.\nIt is both shocking and surreal, which of course the Julian Assange case is as well.\nBut real journalism should be able to get through the shocking and the surreal and get to the truth.\nThere is so much collusion now, with all these dark and menacing developments.\nIt is almost as if the word \u201cjournalism\u201d is becoming blighted.\nDB: There has certainly been a lot of collusion when it comes to Israel.\nThen the word \u201ccollusion\u201d is quite appropriate.\nJP:That\u2019s the ultimate collusion.\nBut that\u2019s collusion with silence.\nNever has there been a collusion like the one between the U.S. and Israel.\nIt suggests another word and that is \u201cimmunity.\u201d It has a moral immunity, a cultural immunity, a geopolitical immunity, a legal immunity, and certainly a media immunity.\nWe see the gunning down of over 60 people on the day of the inauguration of the new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem.\nIsrael has some of the most wickedly experimental munitions in the world and they fired them at people who were protesting the occupation of their homeland and trying to remind people of the Nakba and the right of return.\nIn the media these were described as \u201cclashes.\u201d Although they did become so bad that The New York Times in a later edition changed its front page headline to say that Israel was actually killing people.\nA rare moment, indeed, when the immunity, the collusion was interrupted.\nAll the talk of Iran and nuclear weapons is without any reference to the biggest nuclear power in the Middle East.\nDB: What would you say have been the contributions that Julian Assange has made in this age of censorship and cowardice in journalism?\nWhere does he come into the picture?\nJP:I think it comes down to information.\nIf you go back to when WikiLeaks started, when Julian was sitting in his hotel room in Paris beginning to put the whole thing together, one of the first things he wrote was that there is a morality in transparency, that we have a right to know what those who wish to control our lives are doing in secret.\nThe right to know what governments are doing in our name\u2014on our behalf or to our detriment\u2014is our moral right.\nJulian feels very passionately about this.\nThere were times when he could have compromised slightly in order to possibly help his situation.\nThere were times when I said to him, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just suspend that for a while and go along with it?\u201d Of course, I knew beforehand what his answer would be and that was \u201cno.\u201d The enormous amount of information that has come from WikiLeaks, particularly in recent years, has amounted to an extraordinary public service.\nI was reading just the other day a 2006 WikiLeaks cable from the U.S. embassy in Caracas which was addressed to other agencies in the region.\nThis was four years after the U.S. tried to get rid of Chavez in a coup.\nIt detailed how subversion should work.\nOf course, they dressed it up as human rights work and so on.\nI was reading this official document thinking how the information contained in it was worth years of the kind of distorted reporting from Venezuela.\nIt also reminds us that so-called \u201cmeddling\u201d by Russia in the U.S. is just nonsense.\nThe word \u201cmeddling\u201d doesn\u2019t apply to the kind of action implied in this document.\nIt is intervention in another country\u2019s affairs.\nWikiLeaks has done that all over the world.\nIt has given people the information they have a right to have.\nThey had a right to find out from the so-called \u201cWar Logs\u201d the criminality of our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nThey had a right to find out about Cablegate.\nThat\u2019s when, on Clinton\u2019s watch, we learned that the NSA was gathering personal information on members of the United Nations Security Council, including their credit card numbers.\nYou can see why Julian made enemies.\nBut he should also have made a huge number of friends.\nThis is critical information because it tells us how power works and we will never learn about it otherwise.\nI think WikiLeaks has opened a world of transparency and put flesh on the expression \u201cright to know.\u201d This must explain why he is attacked so much, because that is so threatening.\nThe enemy to great power is not the likes of the Taliban, it is us.\nDB: And who can forget the release of the \u201ccollateral murder\u201d footage by Chelsea Manning?\nJP: That kind of thing is not uncommon.\nVietnam was meant to be the open war but really it wasn\u2019t.\nThere weren\u2019t the cameras around.\nIt is indeed shocking information but it informs people, and we have Chelsea Manning\u2019s courage to thank for that.\nDB: Yes, and the thanks he got was seven years in solitary confinement.\nThey want to prosecute Assange and maybe hang him from the rafters in Congress, but what about Judith Miller and The New York Times lying the West into war?\nThere is no end of horrific examples of what passes for journalism, in contrast to the amazing contribution that Julian Assange has made.\nClick here to listen to this interview.\n", ["Repetition", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Appeal_to_fear-prejudice",

Bias\nAccording to a 33-year-long study conducted by the National Home Education Research Institute in Oregon, the top three reasons that parents choose homeschooling are a desire to provide religious instruction or different values than those offered in public schools; dissatisfaction with the academic curriculum, and worries about the school environment.\nAs reported by The Washington Times, the recent school shooting at Parkland, Fla., was the last straw for scores of parents.\nThe paper noted that \u201cthe phones started ringing at the Texas Home School Coalition, and they haven\u2019t stopped yet.\u201d\nThe Times added:The Lubbock-based organization has been swamped with inquiries for months from parents seeking safer options for their kids in the aftermath of this year\u2019s deadly school massacres, first in Parkland and then in Santa Fe, Texas.\n\u201cWhen the Parkland shooting happened, our phone calls and emails exploded,\u201d said coalition president Tim Lambert.\n\u201cIn the last couple of months, our numbers have doubled.\nWe\u2019re dealing with probably between 1,200 and 1,400 calls and emails per month, and prior to that it was 600 to 700.\u201d\nWhile the debate rages anew over familiar topics following such tragedies \u2014 tougher, more restrictive gun control laws and bolstering security at public schools \u2014 the revolution in homeschooling has been taking place quietly, behind the scenes and off the radar screens of most political organizations.\nBut again, it\u2019s not just the shootings, which admittedly have increased in the past couple of years.\nChristopher Chin, head of Homeschool Louisiana, told The Times that parents are fed up with \u201cthe violence, the bullying, the unsafe environments.\u201d\nThe Left is driving more kids OUT of public schools\nThere is also the Left-wing social engineering.\nThe craziness over transgender students and bathrooms/locker rooms, allowing students to \u201ctake a knee\u201d during the playing of the National Anthem, the Left-wing curriculum, and refusing to allow students to wear shirts that praise POTUS Trump or feature the American flag are also driving parents into homeschooling.\nREMNANT COMMENT: We here at The Remnant are always eager to promote the home-schooling movement, and this report helps illustrate why.\nAt the moment and personally speaking, my own family\u2019s home-school is going great guns.\nWe have a daughter still in high school and three in grade school.\nOur family couldn't be happier with our decision to homeschool---yes, all the way through high school.\nAnd as for our older home-schooled children: My third-eldest child is preparing to head off to college in the fall.\nHer older sister just finished a semester studying in Austria and will graduate with a double major and a minor degree next spring.\nMy son will be a junior this fall, working on a Mass Communications degree at Franciscan University.\nHere's an example of his work:\nPerhaps this video from a couple of years ago will be useful to those considering home-schooling this fall:\nFriends, please give serious thought and prayer to home-schooling your children.\nI realize it\u2019s a challenge, but few challenges have greater payoffs in this world or the next.\nThere is no better way to keep the Catholic family

Horowitz has released his 500 plus-page report, which purports to shine a light on the mishandling at top levels of the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation of the 2016 investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private e-mail server while she served as Secretary of State under former President Obama.\nSuch mishandling included violations of Department of Justice standards and FBI protocols.\nThe report from the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d) criticized certain actions and decisions of former FBI Director James Comey, together with those of other senior FBI officials who were involved in the probe, including former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe.\nMr. McCabe is already the subject of an earlier criminal referral from the OIG for his alleged unauthorized leaks to the media and lying to federal investigators about his media contacts.\nSpecial FBI agent Peter Stzrok and Lisa Page, an attorney who has since left the FBI, were targeted in this report for their blatantly anti-Trump text messages.\nFormer Attorney General Loretta Lynch was also criticized for exercising bad judgment in connection with her infamous tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton.\nMr. Horowitz\u2019s report focused on process and procedures.\nThe inspector general made clear when he launched his investigation in January 2017 that \u201chis review will not substitute the OIG's judgment for the judgments made by the FBI or the Department regarding the substantive merits of investigative or prosecutive decisions.\"\nMoreover, this report did not address whether the Department of Justice or FBI abused the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to obtain a surveillance order against former Trump campaign advisor Carter Page, or the government\u2019s reliance on former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele\u2019s salacious and unverified \u201cdossier\u201d in its FISA court application, which the OIG is investigating separately.\nIn analyzing the highly anticipated OIG report\u2019s conclusions, it is clear that either Mr. Horowitz himself decided to pull his punches or that the final version, which had been reviewed by upper echelons in both the FBI and Justice Department before its public release, emerged in a disappointingly watered-down form.\nTo be sure, the report faulted Comey for deviating from FBI and Justice Department procedures in handling the probe into Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private e-mail server while she served as Secretary of State, thereby negatively impacting \u201cthe perception of the FBI and the department as fair administrators of justice.\u201d Comey, according to the OIG report, \u201cengaged in ad hoc decision making based on his personal views even if it meant rejecting longstanding Department policy or practice.\u201d\nStarting with Comey\u2019s public announcement on July 5, 2016 criticizing Hillary Clinton and her staff for being \u201cextremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information,\u201d but also announcing that the FBI was \u201cexpressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case,\u201d Comey was taken to task for insubordination and usurping the authority of the attorney general.\nHe \u201cupset the well-established separation between investigative and prosecutorial functions,\u201d the report said.\nComey\u2019s follow-up letters to Congress on October 28 and November 6, 2016 were similarly criticized.\nThe first letter informed Congress that agents were reopening their probe into Clinton\u2019s handling of classified material after discovering her e-mails on the laptop of Andrew Weiner, the husband of Clinton\u2019s top aide Huma Abedin.\nThis letter was followed on November 6, 2016 by Comey\u2019s statement that the review of the additional information had been completed and that the FBI remained convinced that charges were not appropriate.\nComey acted against the advice of senior Justice Department officials in making these disclosures the way he did.\nThe OIG report was highly critical of the FBI\u2019s failure to take immediate action on the Weiner laptop when they first learned about it in late September 2016, rather than waiting another month so close to the election.\nThe criticisms of Comey's undisciplined behavior was all well and good, but it was reasonable to expect something more than the equivalent of a departmental employee review after nearly a year and a half of investigation.\nHillary Clinton\u2019s supporters will no doubt jump on the inspector general\u2019s criticisms of Comey\u2019s handling of the July 5th announcement and subsequent letters as proof that he improperly influenced the outcome of the election in President Trump\u2019s favor, even if he did not do so deliberately for political reasons.\nHowever, what Comey really did was to give Hillary Clinton a Get Out of Jail Free card.\nThe fix was in as early as May 2016, well before the FBI interviews of Hillary Clinton and of as many as 17 other key witnesses, when Comey began the process of drafting an exoneration memo.\nComey\u2019s initial draft statement, which he shared with FBI senior leadership on May 2, criticized Clinton\u2019s handling of classified information as \u201cgrossly negligent,\u201d but concluded that \u201cno reasonable prosecutor\u201d would bring a case based on the facts developed in the investigation.\nIndeed, Comey admitted in his book that \u201cwe started the Clinton investigation aware that it was unlikely to be a case that career prosecutors at the Department of Justice would prosecute.\u201d\nIf putting the cart of exoneration before the horse of investigation were not enough, Comey\u2019s draft statement underwent various language changes over the course of the next two months, including, most importantly, changing the description of Clinton\u2019s handling of classified information from \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d to \u201cextremely careless.\u201d This change was critical because \u201cgross negligence\u201d is specifically the legal term used in stating the statutory requirement in 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 793(f) for a finding of criminal conduct.\nComey\u2019s substitution of a legally meaningless phrase, \u201cextremely careless,\u201d for the \u201cgross negligence\u201d statutory legal standard he had originally used, had the effect of prejudging the facts in Hillary Clinton\u2019s favor.\nAndrew McCabe, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were involved in the edits.\nInspector General Horowitz saw no problem with this pattern of obfuscation regarding the deletion of the legally significant phrase \u201cgross negligence\u201d from Comey\u2019s statement.\nMr. Horowitz relied in part on opinions from prosecutors that there was not enough evidence to charge Clinton with acting in a manner that rose to a level of criminal gross negligence with respect to sending or receiving e-mails determined to contain classified information.\nMr. Horowitz\u2019s report thus concluded, \u201cWe did not identify evidence of bias or improper considerations.\u201d This conclusion defies common sense.\nGross negligence is not the same as willful intent, which Comey and his team sought to conflate in exonerating Hillary Clinton before the investigation was concluded.\nClinton was fully aware of what she was doing when she set up the private server arrangement in the first place and knowingly used it to send and receive e-mails involving official government business, which by their very nature would be expected to include classified information.\nIt turns out that some of the e-mails were accessed by foreign parties.\nHillary lied repeatedly when she first denied there were any classified e-mails on her system and then described some of the e-mails involved in the investigation as having been classified after the fact.\nAs Comey has admitted, several e-mail chains concerned matters that were classified at the Top Secret/Special Access Program level when they were sent and received by Clinton.\nCoupled with her agents\u2019 destruction of thousands of e-mails that had been subpoenaed by Congress, Hillary\u2019s conduct was criminally reckless at the very least, if not constituting willful intent to commit an act she knew was wrongful.\nYet Mr. Horowitz saw no reason to doubt the sincerity of Comey's explanations for giving Hillary a free pass.\nThe failure to at least empanel a grand jury to compel testimony from Hillary Clinton and key witnesses was itself a complete dereliction of duty, which could have only been motivated by a desire to treat Hillary Clinton with kid gloves for improper reasons.\nIncredibly, however, Mr. Horowitz\u2019s report \u201cfound no persuasive evidence\u2026 that the outcome of the investigation would have been different had Clinton been subpoenaed before the grand jury.\u201d\nMr. Horowitz also did not deem Comey\u2019s possible perjury in his testimony before Congress to be an appropriate subject for criminal referral.\nComey testified that his decision to exonerate Hillary was not made before her interview took place, when for all intents and purposes it was.\nMr. Horowitz simply took Comey\u2019s word for what he had meant.\nInspector General Horowitz again emphasized form and process over substance in finding a \u201ctroubling lack of any direct, substantive communication\u201d between Comey and Attorney General Lynch ahead of Comey\u2019s July 5 press conference on Clinton and his October 28 letter to Congress.\nAttorney General Lynch\u2019s infamous tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton was discussed in the report, but mostly in the context of how it affected Comey\u2019s decision to go rogue, so to speak, in making his July 5th announcement without prior approval from the Justice Department.\nAs to the substance of Ms. Lynch\u2019s decision to meet with Bill Clinton at all before his wife\u2019s FBI interview, all Mr. Horowitz\u2019s report had to say was that it was \u201can error in judgment.\u201d\nThe OIG report also criticized the conduct of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who had exchanged text messages sharply critical of Mr. Trump before and after the election, for casting \u201ca cloud over the entire FBI investigation.\u201d The report referenced a text message on August 8, 2016, in which Strzok reassured Page that she need not worry about Donald Trump becoming president.\nTrump is \u201cnot ever going to become president, right?\nRight?\n!\u201d Page texted Strzok.\n\u201cNo.\nNo he\u2019s not.\nWe\u2019ll stop it,\u201d Strzok responded.\nMr. Horowitz wrote that this exchange was \u201cnot only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate\u2019s electoral prospects.\u201d The inspector general questioned whether Strzok\u2019s decision to prioritize the Russia collusion investigation over following up on the Clinton e-mail-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias.\nUltimately, however, he inexplicably concluded that there was no finding of \u201cdocumentary or testimonial evidence that improper considerations, including political bias, directly affected the specific investigative decisions\u201d discussed in the OIG report.\nStrzok should have been subject to a criminal referral for arguably violating 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 595, enacted as part of the original 1939 Hatch Act, prohibiting any public officer or employee, in connection with an activity financed wholly or in part by the United States, from using his or her official authority to interfere with or affect the nomination or election of a candidate for federal office including the president of the United States.\nThe punishment for violation is a fine, imprisonment for not more than one year or both.\nInstead, Strzok's punishment will most likely be limited to disciplinary action and possibly dismissal.\nIn sum, the long-awaited inspector general report on the FBI\u2019s and Justice Department\u2019s handling of the Hillary Clinton e-mail investigation is as disappointing as the rigged outcome of the e-mail investigation itself.\n", ["Repetition", "Loaded_Language", "Exaggeration,Minimisation", "Doubt"]], ["Clinton Email IG Report Rips FBI, Comey, & Lynch\u2026 Plus A Whole Lot

manner in the Clinton email case.\nHowever, the Inspector General left the door open to the possibility that political bias did indeed play a role, as his current investigation in the Russia-Collusion probe of the FBI and the DOJ could reveal new evidence to damn the FBI\u2019s Obama era leadership.\nWhile the report refuses to say conclusively that political bias was the animus behind the FBI\u2019s handling of the Clinton probe, it also indicates that IG Horowitz may have more to say about the FBI\u2019s political leanings in his Russia report.\nThe Washington Post explains:\nThe Justice Department inspector general on Thursday castigated former FBI Director James B. Comey for his actions during the Hillary Clinton email investigation and found that other senior bureau officials showed a \u201cwillingness to take official action\u201d to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president\u2026 Some senior bureau officials, the report found, exhibited a disturbing \u201cwillingness to take official action\u201d to hurt Trump\u2019s chances to become president.\nPerhaps the most damaging new revelation in the report is a previously-unreported text message in which Peter Strzok, a key investigator on both the Clinton email case and the investigation of Russia and the Trump campaign, assured an FBI lawyer in August 2016 that \u201cwe\u2019ll stop\u201d Trump from making it to the White House.\n\u201c[Trump\u2019s] not ever going to become president, right?\nRight?\n!\u201d the lawyer, Lisa Page, wrote to Strzok.\n\u201cNo.\nNo he won\u2019t.\nWe\u2019ll stop it,\u201d Strzok responded\u2026\nThe inspector general concluded that Strzok\u2019s text, along with others disparaging Trump, \u201cis not only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate\u2019s electoral prospects.\u201d\nThe messages \u201cpotentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations,\u201d the inspector general wrote\u2026\nStrzok has argued that he was just trying to reassure Page that Trump couldn\u2019t win, and that he wasn\u2019t implying that they would take action to stop his election.\nBut it wasn\u2019t just Page and Strzok, there were FIVE other investigators on the Clinton case who expressed overtly political views in support of Clinton and/or against Trump\u2026 DURING the investigation.\nPage and Strzok are not the only FBI officials assigned to the Clinton email probe who were found to have exchanged personal messages indicating either an animus against Trump or frustration with the fact that the FBI was investigating Clinton.\nThe report identified five officials with some connection to the email probe who were expressing political views, faulting them for having brought \u201cdiscredit to themselves, sowed doubt about the FBI\u2019s handling of the midyear investigation, and impacted the reputation of the FBI.\u201d The midyear investigation refers to the Clinton email probe.\n\u201cThe messages cast a cloud over the FBI investigations to which these employees were assigned,\u201d Horowitz alleged.\n\u201cUltimately the consequences of these actions impact not only the senders of these messages but also other who worked on these investigation and, indeed, the entire FBI.\u201d\nThe IG also found that the FBI moved slowly on new evidence that could have damned Hillary Clinton, and did so for reasons that make no sense.\nThe report took particular aim at FBI officials investigating Clinton\u2019s email server for moving slowly after agents in the New York Field office discovered messages on the laptop of disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner that might be relevant to their case.\nBy no later than September 29, the inspector general alleged, the bureau had learned \u201cvirtually every fact\u201d it would cite as justification late the next month to search Weiner\u2019s laptop for messages of Clinton and top aide Huma Abedin.\nThe inspector general derided the bureau\u2019s reasons for not moving more quickly \u2014 that agents were waiting for additional information from New York, that they couldn\u2019t move without a warrant and that investigators were more focused on the Russia case \u2014 as \u201cunpersuasive,\u201d \u201cillogical,\u201d and inconsistent with their assertion that they would leave no stone unturned on Clinton.\nThe report also faulted the bureau for assigning essentially the same personnel to the Russia and Clinton teams, and singled out Strzok, suggesting his anti-Trump views might have played a role in his not acting more expeditiously on the new lead.\n\u201cUnder these circumstances, we did not have confidence that Strzok\u2019s decision to prioritize the Russia investigation over following up on the Midyear-related investigative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias,\u201d the report said.\nDid you get that?\nIG Horowitz can\u2019t prove it, but he\u2019s not sure that Strzok wasn\u2019t acting in a politically biased manner when he slow-played the Clinton investigation while moving more quickly on the Russia investigation.\nHow in the world can we trust them even as they express bias while investigating malfeasance?\nWe see this kind of corruption all over the world, why should believe that these officials could be immune to acting on their personal biases?\nThere were 7 of them on the case, and they were comfortable enough with each other to express their biases openly and none of them ever chastised the others for expressing those biases!\nNot only that, the team that handled Clinton\u2019s investigation so poorly was almost the identical team that was then assigned to handle the Russia investigation!\nMeaning, the obviously politically biased team that had just cleared the woman that they supported, was now tapped to investigate if the man that they hated was tied to Russian corruption.\nThis is INSANE.\nMeanwhile, another story just breaking at Fox News provides even more evidence that Peter Strzok is the big bad guy in the FBI mess.\nNot only was he slow-playing the Clinton investigation, he may be the only reason she was never charged with a crime.\nIn a newly released FBI email, we learned that \u201cforeign actors\u201d gained at least some access to Hillary Clinton\u2019s unsecure email system.\nFox News obtained the memo prepared by the House Judiciary and Oversight committees, which lays out key interim findings ahead of next week\u2019s hearing with Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz.\nThe IG, separately, is expected to release his highly anticipated report on the Clinton email case later Thursday.\nThe House committees, which conducted a joint probe into decisions made by the DOJ in 2016 and 2017, addressed a range of issues in their memo including Clinton\u2019s email security.\n\u201cDocuments provided to the Committees show foreign actors obtained access to some of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s emails \u2014 including at least one email classified \u2018Secret,'\u201d the memo says, adding that foreign actors also accessed the private accounts of some Clinton staffers.\nHere\u2019s the email in question:\nPeter Strzok email about Clinton emails by Fox News on Scribd\nThe email came from FBI agent Peter Strzok and it\u2019s the first place we see the question of whether or not Clinton can be found as \u201cgrossly negligent,\u201d in the handling of classified intel.\nRemember, Strzok is widely credited as the man who changed FBI Director Comey\u2019s language on the Clinton email investigation from the prosecutable \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d to the legally superflous \u201cextremely careless.\u201d\nAt HotAir.com John Sexton explains the importance of this discovery:\nIn the FBI memo, you can already see the genesis of the distinction the FBI would rely on to clear Clinton.\nStrzok writes that the media has been focused on the question of why Hillary seems to be getting a pass when \u201cPetraeus/Berger/Libby\u201d did not.\nHe writes, \u201cWe draw the distinction in noting we have no evidence classified information was ever shared with an unauthorized party, i.e.\nnotwithstanding the server setup, we have not seen classified information shared with a member of the media, an agent of a foreign power, a lover, etc.\u201d In other words, Hillary may have been hacked but she didn\u2019t intentionally give anything away.\nOf course, the statute itself didn\u2019t make intent a prerequisite.\nHerridge reports that the House committee memo once again raises this same issue: \u201cOfficials from both agencies have created a perception they misinterpreted the Espionage Act by stating Secretary Clinton lacked the requisite \u2018intent\u2019 for charges to be filed,\u201d the memo says, before pointing to statements by Comey that indicated a belief that intent was required \u2014 which the memo says ignored \u201cmeaningful aspects\u201d of the law.\nIt really does seem that Strzok, an agent who had a personal pro-Hillary bias, was the person who pushed to let her off the hook by focusing on her intent rather than her negligence setting up the server in the first place.\nI fully believe IG Horowitz\u2019 findings here.\nI believe that he was unable to prove that there was any political motive to the FBI\u2019s handling of the Clinton email case, and I believe that while the case was obviously mishandled, it could have reached the conclusion it did honorably.\nHowever, I also think that the IG has purposely left room in his conclusion to amend that decision after he\u2019s concluded his Russia investigation.\nIn fact, there are already signs of him doing that in this report.\nMuch of the information that he uses to chastise Strzok\u2019s behavior and judgment in the Clinton email case, would have actually come from his current investigation into the Russia mess.\nIt\u2019s quite possible that as bad as this report is for Comey, Strzok, Page, and Obama\u2019s FBI leadership\u2026 Horowitz\u2019 conclusion in the Russia investigation could prove to be even worse.\nWe\u2019ll see.\nArticle posted with permission from Constitution.com\n", ["Repetition", "Flag-Waving", "Doubt", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling,Labeling",

general interest in the Qur\u2019an among non-Muslims is to seek an answer to the question of whether or not it justifies and encourages Islamic terrorism.\nWith What the Qur\u2019an Meant: And Why It Matters, religion author Garry Wills is here to reassure us:\nWhat did the scripture of Islam tell me about the duty to kill infidels?\nSome people are sure it is there, though it isn\u2019t.\nThen what does it say about Shari\u2019ah law?\nNot a thing (p. 7).\nThat would be good to know, were Wills a reliable witness.\nUnfortunately, he proves to be just the opposite: Wills laments \u201cRobert Spencer of Jihad Watch calling for a ban on the Qur\u2019an\u201d (p. 58).\nI have never called for such a ban, and oppose in principle the banning of any book.\nWills, not surprisingly, does not offer any quotation from me to back up his false claim.\nHis manifest unreliability on this point casts a shadow on his primary assertions about the Qur\u2019an.\nWills seems determined to put the best possible face on the Qur\u2019an, which requires him to ignore a great deal of Qur\u2019anic incitement and hatred.\nFor example, he quotes 5:51 -- \u201cYou who believe, do not take the Jews and Christians as allies\u201d (p. 114) -- but he nonetheless concludes, after ten pages of tu quoque arguments and other legerdemain, that \u201cthe Qur\u2019an is fraternal in its treatment of other faiths\u201d (p. 124).\nWills never mentions Qur\u2019an 9:29, which commands Muslims to wage war against Jews and Christians and subjugate them as inferiors under the rule of Sharia.\nWills is no more trustworthy when he deals with the question of violence in the Qur\u2019an.\nHe renders one key passage in this way: \u201cFight then until there is no more persecution, and worship [at the shrine] is devoted to God\u201d (2:193; p. 133).\nWhence the bracketed interpolation \u201cat the shrine\u201d?\nWills doesn\u2019t give any source for it; apparently it comes from none other than Garry Wills himself.\nBy adding \u201cat the shrine\u201d to this verse, Wills restricts the call to fight to the area around the Sacred Mosque in Mecca.\nHe ignores the fact that some Islamic authorities see this passage as calling for nothing less than unlimited warfare against non-Muslims.\nThe prominent Twentieth Century Indian Islamic scholar Muhammad Ashiq Ilahi Bulandshahri explains the passage this way:\nThe worst of sins are Infidelity ( Kufr) and Polytheism ( shirk) which constitute rebellion against Allah, The Creator.\nTo eradicate these, Muslims are required to wage war until there exists none of it in the world, and the only religion is that of Allah.\nWills doesn\u2019t mention the existence of such interpretations, even to dismiss them.\nLikewise, when he claims that the Qur\u2019an has \u201cnot a thing\u201d to say about Sharia, he appears unaware that the Qur\u2019an is one of the sources of Sharia.\nThe Qur\u2019an\u2019s declarations that a woman\u2019s testimony is worth half that of a man\u2019s (2:282), that a daughter is to receive a smaller part of an inheritance than a son receives (4:11), that thieves are to have their hands amputated (5:38), and that those who \u201cwage war against Allah and his messenger\u201d are to be crucified or have a hand and foot amputated on opposite sides (5:33) are part of Sharia in all its various expressions.\nBecause these stipulations are found in the Qur\u2019an, they cannot be questioned or set aside.\nThroughout his book, Wills\u2019 assurances that the Qur\u2019an is not really as bad as \u201cright-wing Islamophobes\u201d say, or that the Bible contains material that is just as bad or worse, dissolve under close scrutiny.\nAgain and again it turns out that Wills has ignored key passages in order to make his case.\nHe asks why the Qur\u2019an is \u201cso ferocious to \u2018hypocrites\u2019 and apostates\u201d (p. 124).\nThen he offers a quotation from the New Testament Letter to the Hebrews saying that \u201cif we sin again on purpose\u201d there is \u201conly a terrifying judgment to come\u201d (p. 126).\nWills concludes: \u201cThe Qur\u2019an is not as absolute as this, because it always leaves room for God\u2019s inexhaustible mercy and forgiveness\u201d (p. 126).\nThat sounds wonderful, and certainly pleasing to multicultural ears to learn that the Qur\u2019an is more merciful than the New Testament.\nUntil one realizes that, in his discussion of apostasy in the Qur\u2019an, Wills has omitted all mention of the primary Qur\u2019anic passage on this topic:\ntake our poll - story continues below Whom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you consider

and benign as Garry Wills makes it out to be, why do so very many Muslims worldwide misunderstand it?\nThe Islamic State (ISIS), in its heyday, quoted the Qur\u2019an frequently -- odd behavior if the group actually was ignorant of, indifferent to, or in violation of the book\u2019s core tenets.\nISIS quoted the Qur\u2019an extensively in threats to blow up the White House and conquer Rome and Spain; in explaining its priorities in the nations it is targeting in jihad; in preaching to Christians after collecting the jizya (a Qur\u2019an-based tax, cf.\nQur\u2019an 9:29); in justifying the execution of accused spies; and in its various videos.\nISIS also awarded $10,000 prizes and sex slaves in Qur\u2019an memorization contests.\nOne of its underground lairs was found littered with weapons and copies of the Qur\u2019an.\nChildren in the Islamic State study the Qur\u2019an and get weapons training.\nOne Malaysian Muslim said that the Qur\u2019an led him to join the Islamic State.\nA Muslima in the U.S. promoted the Islamic State by quoting the Qur\u2019an.\nAn Islamic State propagandist\u2019s parents said of him: \u201cOur son is a devout Muslim.\nHe had learnt the Quran by heart.\u201d A Muslim politician from Jordan said that the Islamic State\u2019s \u201cdoctrine stems from the Qur\u2019an and Sunnah.\u201d\nHow would Garry Wills explain all that?\nHe can\u2019t; he has just explained all Qur\u2019anic violence and intolerance away, leaving the manifest fact that all too many Muslims worldwide think that the Qur\u2019an says exactly what he claims it does not say an unanswered conundrum.\nWills\u2019 na\u00efve, inaccurate, misleadingly sunny view of the Qur\u2019an, of course, accords with that of his fellow Leftist Catholic, Pope Francis.\nFrancis has proclaimedpreposterously that \u201cauthentic Islam and the proper reading of the Koran are opposed to every form of violence.\u201d Wills\u2019 book accords well with the present-day Catholic Church\u2019s head-in-the-sand posture toward Qur\u2019an-based Islamic jihad violence and the Muslim persecution of the ancient Christian communities of the Middle East.\nIt isn\u2019t remotely accurate, but it feels good, and for the Catholic and Leftist establishment today, that seems to be all that matters.\nArticle posted with permission from Robert Spencer\n",

protect themselves or be part of the constitutional militia.\nThe AMA also wants to bypass the Fifth Amendment protections concerning someone actually being indicted and found guilty of a crime being deprived of their liberty and property as they promote a new legal procedure by which \u201cfamily members, intimate partners, household members and law enforcement personnel\u201d can petition courts

stalking from possessing or purchasing firearms.\nExpanding domestic violence restraining orders to include dating partners.\nRequiring states to have protocols or processes in place for requiring the removal of firearms by prohibited persons.\nRequiring domestic violence restraining orders and gun violence restraining orders to be entered into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.\nEfforts to ensure the public is aware of the existence of laws that allow for the removal of firearms from high-risk individuals.\nThe delegates also modified existing policy to: Recognize the role of firearms in suicides.\nEncourage the development of curricula and training for physicians with a focus on suicide risk assessment and prevention as well as lethal means safety counseling.\nEncourage physicians, as a part of their suicide prevention strategy, to discuss lethal means safety and work with families to reduce access to lethal means of suicide.\nNewly adopted policy also means the AMA will:\nAdvocate for schools to remain gun-free zones except for school-sanctioned activities and professional law enforcement officials.\nOppose requirements or incentives of teachers to carry weapons.\nThey also oppose concealed carry reciprocity, which I do as well, but based on the principle that the Second Amendment's protections extend to the various states as well, since it recognizes a right, not a permission, to keep and bear arms.\nI also oppose it because it's just another step for the federal government to say they need a database so states can check, thus

Muhammad to ISIS .\nTo take one of innumerable examples, Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi, a fifteenth-century Persian who wrote a biography of the Mongol Muslim warrior Tamerlane, observed that \u201cthe Qur\u2019an says the highest dignity man can attain is that of making war in person against the enemies of his religion.\nMuhammad advises the same thing, according to the tradition of the Muslim doctors: wherefore the great Temur always strove to exterminate the infidels, as much to acquire that glory, as to signalise himself by the greatness of his conquests.\u201d\nAfter conquest came dhimmitude, the subjugated status that the Qur\u2019an mandates for \u201cthe People of the Book\u201d (primarily Jews and Christians).\nIn the early twelfth century, the Fatimid caliph Al-Amir bi-Ahkamillah issued this edict:\nNow, the prior degradation of the infidels in this world before the life to come\u2014where it is their lot\u2014is considered an act of piety; and the imposition of their poll tax [jizya], \u201cuntil they pay the tribute out of hand and have been humbled\u201d (Koran 9:29) is a divinely ordained obligation\u2026.The dhimmi\u2019s payment of his dues by a bill drawn on a Muslim, or by delegating a real believer to pay it in his name will not be tolerated.\nIt must be exacted from him directly in order to vilify and humiliate him, so that Islam and its people may be exalted and the race of infidels brought low.\nThe jizya is to be imposed on all of them in full, without exception.\nUnderlying this subjugation is a deep contempt for non-Muslims.\nIn the year 718, the Umayyad caliph Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz sent out a message to the governors of the various Islamic provinces:\nO you who believe!\nThe non-Muslims are nothing but dirt.\nAllah has created them to be partisans of Satan; most treacherous in regard to all they do; whose whole endeavor in this nether life is useless, though they themselves imagine that they are doing fine work.\nUpon them rests the curse of Allah, of the Angels and of man collectively\nWe must not think that we are at war with the entire religion.\nBut what, Mr. Farage, are we to think about the

Member of the Federal Parliament, Malcolm Turnbull.\nI wanted to ask him to deliver a letter from Gareth Peirce, Assange\u2019s lawyer, to the government.\nWe talked about his famous victory \u2014 in the 1980s when, as a young barrister, he had fought the British Government\u2019s attempts to suppress free speech and prevent the publication of the book Spycatcher \u2014 in its way, a WikiLeaks of the time, for it revealed the crimes of state power.\nThe prime minister of Australia was then Julia Gillard, a Labor Party politician who had declared WikiLeaks \u201cillegal\u201d and wanted to cancel Assange\u2019s passport \u2014 until she was told she could not do this: that Assange had committed no crime: that WikiLeaks was a publisher, whose work was protected under Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which Australia was one of the original signatories.\nIn abandoning Assange, an Australian citizen, and colluding in his persecution, Prime Minister Gillard\u2019s outrageous behaviour forced the issue of his recognition, under international law, as a political refugee whose life was at risk.\nEcuador invoked the 1951 Convention and granted Assange refuge in its embassy in London.\nGillard has recently been appearing in a gig with Hillary Clinton; they are billed as pioneering feminists.\nIf there is anything to remember Gillard by, it a warmongering, sycophantic, embarrassing speech she made to the US Congress soon after she demanded the illegal cancellation of Julian\u2019s passport.\nMalcolm Turnbull is now the Prime Minister of Australia.\nJulian Assange\u2019s father has written to Turnbull.\nIt is a moving letter, in which he has appealed to the prime minister to bring his son home.\nHe refers to the real possibility of a tragedy.\nI have watched Assange\u2019s health deteriorate in his years of confinement without sunlight.\nHe has had a relentless cough, but is not even allowed safe passage to and from a hospital for an X-ray.\nMalcolm Turnbull can remain silent.\nOr he can seize this opportunity and use his government\u2019s diplomatic influence to defend the life of an Australian citizen, whose courageous public service is recognised by countless people across the world.\nHe can bring Julian Assange home.\nReprinted with permission from Consortiumnews.com.\n", ["Repetition", "Doubt",

of the hypocrisy of the US Conference of Mayors is that they actually push to infringe on law-abiding citizens' rights while claiming that it is consistent with the Second Amendment.\nFor example, the organization writes in support of David Hogg's #NeverAgain movement, \"WHEREAS, the U.S. Conference of Mayors has a 50-year history of formally adopting and aggressively promoting strong policies to reduce gun violence, all consistent with its support for the Second Amendment to the Constitution.\"\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat

time;\nBanning replica handguns;\nIncreasing inspections of licensed gun dealers; and\nTargeting and holding responsible gun dealers who break the law by knowingly selling guns to straw purchasers; Banning Assault Weapons and Large-Capacity Magazines, including: Reinstating a strengthened, effective ban on military-style assault weapons, such as AK-47s, and their component parts; and\nBanning large capacity ammunition feeding devices and the importation of all large capacity ammunition clips.\nSupporting Local Efforts to Reduce and Combat Gun Crimes, including: Opposing concealed carry reciprocity policies and legislation that would circumvent city policies established to protect residents;\nProviding local governments and law enforcement officials access to ATF gun trace data;\nOpposing \"Stand Your Ground\"\u009d or \"Shoot First\"\u009d laws and urging state legislatures that have adopted such laws to repeal them; and\nEncouraging mayors to take executive actions to combat gun violence and illegal use and trafficking of guns; Protecting Young People, including: Opposing proposals to allow teachers and other non-law enforcement, non-security personnel to carry firearms in K-12 schools;\nRaising the youth handgun ban from 18 to 21 years of age;\nBanning juvenile possession of semiautomatic assault rifles; and Holding gun owners criminally liable when children gain access to improperly stored guns.\nProtecting Domestic Violence Victims, including:\nProhibiting persons convicted of domestic violence crimes or subject to final domestic violence restraining orders from acquiring or possessing firearms; and\nRequiring prohibited domestic abusers to turn in firearms they already own;\nHow any of this is consistent with support for the Second Amendment is anyone's guess.\nI think they throw that language in to cover for the fact that they are attacking it head on and attacking the rights of the people.\nHow does any of this stop gun violence?\nIt doesn't.\nWhat it does do is infringe on the rights of teachers, law-abiding citizens who want to purchase several guns which they will use lawfully, sides with criminals against law-abiding citizens as it opposes stand your ground and other measures written specifically to protect people who would normally be victims of crime.\nBanning semi-automatic weapons doesn't stop crime either, as we've pointed out before, and the statistics are available for anyone to see that gun violence didn't go down one bit during the decade of the Clinton/Feinstein assault weapons ban.\nThese geniuses also \"Support Enactment of Comprehensive Background Checks, Ban the Sale of Bump Stocks and Related Devices and Prevent the Arming of Teachers in Schools.\"\nAgain, this will do nothing to stop criminals with guns.\nWhy?\nBecause they won't follow your unconstitutional and unlawful laws in the first place!\nOn top of that, the criminal mayors want to institute red flag laws.\n\"The U.S. Conference of Mayors registers its strong support for extreme risk protection order laws and urges both states and the federal government to enact such laws,\" the group wrote.\nThey are fully in support of violating the Fifth Amendment rights of otherwise law-abiding citizens based on merely the fact that someone claims that a family member is a harm to themselves or others, even though they have not committed a crime.\nThis is the Trump, \"Take the guns first and then due process\" mantra.\nGuns.com reported on some of the statements made by some of these mayors.\nKaren

\u201cPolicies like background checks on all gun sales and Red Flag Laws save lives.\nIt\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d Freeman-Wilson said.\n\u201cThe U.S. Conference of Mayors will continue doing everything in our power to keep our communities safe so that children and families are able to live free of the fear of being gunned down.\u201d St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson said the new resolutions show mayors will \u201clead the way in solving our gun violence crisis.\u201d \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be doing our jobs as mayors if we weren\u2019t focusing on gun violence \u2014 an issue that threatens the public safety of every community, big and small,\u201d she said.\n\u201cOur bipartisan network of mayors knows how to work together and compromise on policies that save lives.\nIf only our partners in Congress did the same.\u201d Gun control groups, including Everytown for Gun Safety and Mayors Against Illegal Guns, praised the conference for reaffirming its support for stricter regulations.\n\u201cMayors are on the frontlines of America\u2019s gun violence crisis, so it\u2019s no surprise they\u2019re also leading the charge to pass common-sense, life-saving laws,\u201d said Everytown president John Feinblatt.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for our leaders in Washington to follow the lead of America\u2019s mayors and put public safety over NRA priorities.\u201d\nNone of these statements can be backed up by facts.\nThe facts refute their arguments, but beyond that, the Second Amendment recognizes the right to keep and bear arms is a right given to us by our Creator, not a permission we gain from government.\nSo, while they tell you they support the Second Amendment and that their unlawful policies are consistent with it, nothing could be further from the truth.\nIf you

Era Jade Helm Connection To The Current Illegal Immigration Policy\nOn the surface, the latest illegal immigration debate between Leftists and the Administration looks like, yet another issue Progressives are trying to undermine progress being done by the president.\nNo one should be surprised by the crackdown on illegals entering the country, especially since it was one of the major campaign promises Donald Trump made before getting elected.\nWhen it comes to the separation of children from their families, there is nothing new today that was not being done during the Obama reign.\nIn 2013, Obama began bringing into the US literally over a hundred thousand people, mainly below age 21.\nThey were bused, flown, and met at the US border with Mexico by the Department of Homeland Security under the direction of Obama to do so.\nSince most of them were adolescents and older teenagers they could not be set free, thus Obama ordered various military bases to house these children.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you consider to be the most corrupt Democrat Politician?\nWhom do you

site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nThe surge of children into the US from various countries south of the border was said to be the result of economics, high crime rates, and actual threats from organized crime entities.\nAnother excuse used by the Obama government was to bring them here to find their families already in the US.\nThus, the idea that separating children from their parents as being something new, done only by the Trump Administration is absurd, since we really have no idea whether the children brought here during the Obama reign were intentionally separated from their parents by the US government at that time, or not.\nWe have only what little information the government told us then, which was not very much, considering the fact that Obama wanted to keep as much of this situation as secret as possible.\nWhat many do not realize is, today's policy of separating underage siblings from their parents once they cross the border illegally into the US seems to be a planned event by the US government going all the way back to the domestic military exercises known as Jade Helm in 2015.\nMany remember the military taking over several Walmart locations, mainly in Texas, during the Jade Helm exercises.\nThis, along with the federal government grab of millions of acres of land during the Obama years, speaks volumes in the government's plan to be able to handle millions of people.\nSince Obama planned to have over a million Muslim refugees brought into the US over a short period of time, along with the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants coming in, one can understand the reason the Feds had to have the Walmart stores and so much land, as they needed housing for the millions they planned to bring in.\nDespite President Trump signing an Executive Order suspending Syrian refugees from entering the US for 120 days on Jan. 26, 2017 while security measures were reviewed, the US still imported 110,000 refugees from Syria and various other countries into the US in 2017 alone, up from 85,000 the previous year.\nThese numbers follow Obama's projections of the expected amount of refugees permitted to come to the US.\nOf course, as with the number of illegal immigrants entering our county, the Feds downplay the actual number which always ends up to be more than quadruple their stated number.\nWhat we seem to have here with the illegal immigration situation today is some very good actors on the Left accusing the Trump Administration of being cruel and insensitive with separating children from their families once they cross the Mexican border into the US.\nWhen in fact, their idol, Obama did the same thing for years during his time in power.\nWhat they do not want to admit to is the fact that today's illegal immigration picture is one that follows the Obama plan on dealing with the influx of illegals to a carbon copy.\nPresident Trump, on the other hand, is following along with it by detaining illegal immigrants at the border and separating children from their apparent families.\nSince no one can know if the children really belong to the illegals who say they are their parents, they are separated until that can be verified, along with other background findings.\nThe bottom line is, both the Left and the Trump Administration seem to be following along with a plan of action going back to Jade Helm which paved the way for the housing needed for such a huge influx of illegal immigrants and refugees.\nAll of which seems to be a planned event.\nIn any case, neither side in DC is really interested in solving the illegal immigration problem or cares about the children involved.\nIf they were, there would be no detention and separation after illegally coming into the US, only an immediate deportation by US Border Patrol on the spot.\n", ["Repetition", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling,Labeling", "Doubt"]], ["Muslim Cleric: \u201cThere Were Jews In Islamic Countries & Caliphates, But We Never Killed Them Just

Xavier Becerra, was secretly copied by authorities after the House Inspector General (IG) identified suspicious activity on it, but the Awans\u2019 physical access was not blocked.\nBut after, the report reads, the server appears to have been secretly replaced with one that looked similar.\nThe memo called for firing the Pakistani-born aides, revoking all their computer accounts, and changing the locks on any door they had access to.\nRep.

face, than they do the souls of men (Luke 19:10), as well as saving their country.\nApparently they have a reputation to keep up.\nPhilippians 2:7-9\nThese are those that sit behind the status of some sort of church or political leader of the pack.\nYet, you do not see any warfare or opposition around them and why?\nbecause they have simply forsaken the cross.\nThere is no absolutes with these

confront the issues that needed to be confronted.\nThe reason they don't is because they are guilty of what they fail to confront!\nThey are paper tigers.\nThey can write all big and bad but when it comes to what someone else should do.\nHowever, when it is time for them to put boots on the ground, they are simply missing in action (MIA).\nThese are willing to live in the freest country in the

of God (Galatians 4:29).\nMaybe this group of people should ask their enemies for instructions as to how change is brought about, and in a righteous sense reverse the lawlessness-taking place in this

downloaded more than 100,000 times.\nWilson made the decision to go all in on the project, dropping out of law school at the University of Texas, as if to confirm his belief that technology supersedes law.\nThe law caught up.\nLess than a week later, Wilson received a letter from the US State Department demanding that he take down his printable-gun blueprints or face prosecution for violating federal export controls.\nUnder an obscure set of US regulations known as the International Trade in Arms Regulations (ITAR), Wilson was accused of exporting weapons without a license, just as if he\u2019d shipped his plastic gun to Mexico rather than put a digital version of it on the internet.\nHe took Defcad.com offline, but his lawyer warned him that he still potentially faced millions of dollars in fines and years in prison simply for having made the file available to overseas downloaders for a few days.\n\u201cI thought my life was over,\u201d Wilson says.\n\u2026\nTwo months ago, the Department of Justice quietly offered Wilson a settlement to end a lawsuit he and a group of co-plaintiffs have pursued since 2015 against the United States government.\nWilson and his team of

Gottlieb.\n\u201cFor years, anti-gunners have contended that modern semi-automatic sport-utility rifles are so-called \u2018weapons of war,\u2019 and with this settlement, the government has acknowledged they are nothing of the sort.\n\u201cUnder this settlement,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe government will draft and pursue regulatory amendments that eliminate ITAR control over the technical information at the center of this case.\nThey will transfer export jurisdiction to the Commerce Department, which does not impose prior restraint on public speech.\nThat will allow Defense Distributed and SAF to publish information about 3-D technology.\u201d The Second Amendment Foundation (www.saf.org) is the nation\u2019s oldest and largest tax-exempt education, research, publishing

and conducts many programs designed to better inform the public about the consequences of gun control.\nWhat does all this mean?\nWell, it's pretty simple, and I highly recommend the Wired article, which is quite lengthy and has lots of information, but what this does is demonstrates that the genie is out of the bottle and there is just no way for gun grabbing Communists the world over to be able to truly enforce their unlawful acts of fun gun confiscation.\nWhy?\nBecause now, anyone with access to the internet and a 3D printer can print their very own gun that is unregistered.\nThat's right, and it's perfectly legal to do so.\nAnd we aren't just talking a rigid looking one-shot handgun.\nWe're talking ARs, 1911s and a host of other guns.\nThis actually may end up undermining the gun manufacturing industry in the future, as people will be able to build their own guns at home in a similar manner to how the internet has had a dramatic effect on the retail brick and mortar stores.\nWilson boasted that his efforts have officially killed gun control.\n\"I barely put a million bucks into this and I got you the Second Amendment forever,\" he told The Daily Wire in a phone interview.\n\"What has the NRA done for you lately?\"\nI don't know that I would go quite that far, after all, the settlement does state that \"the government expressly acknowledges that non-automatic firearms up to .50-caliber \u2013 including modern semi-auto sporting rifles such as the popular AR-15 and similar firearms \u2013 are not inherently military.\"\nTherefore, the government still believes it has a right to regulate certain arms, which it does not have authority to do.\n\"This doesn\u2019t put the rifle in everyone\u2019s hand, but it does that in essence\" he added.\n\"The DNA of our culture is preserved.\nThis is the first pillar in the internet gun culture of tomorrow, and it is permanent.\"\nThis is a huge milestone in the history of our county, and as such, it should be celebrated as a victory.\nAs Joe Wolverton of The New American writes:\n", ["Thought-terminating_Cliches", "Flag-Waving", "Doubt", "Exaggeration,Minimisation", "Loaded_Language",

Vladimir Putin in Helsinki created a firestorm of controversy.\nPresident Trump seemed to be publicly siding with the Russian dictator against the American intelligence agencies.\nThe initial appearance was so bad that I tweeted: \u201cPresident Trump must clarify his statements in Helsinki on our intelligence system and Putin.\nIt is the most serious mistake of his presidency and must be corrected \u2013 immediately.\u201d\nAfter flying home from Helsinki and reviewing the tape and transcript of his press conference with Putin, President Trump said he has \u201cfull faith and support for America\u2019s great intelligence agencies\u201d and that he accepts \u201cour intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election took place.\u201d\nIn his remarks to members of Congress Tuesday that were televised by the media, President Trump went on to admit that he realized he needed to clarify his statements in Helsinki.\nThe president said: \u201cIt should have been obvious \u2013 I thought it would be obvious \u2013 but I would like to clarify, just in case it wasn\u2019t.\nIn a key sentence in my remarks, I said the word \u2018would\u2019 instead of \u201cwouldn\u2019t.\u201d The sentence should have been: I don\u2019t see any reason why I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 or why it wouldn\u2019t be Russia.\nSo just to repeat it, I said the word \u2018would\u2019 instead of \u2018wouldn\u2019t\u2019 \u2026\n\u201cI have, on numerous occasions, noted our intelligence findings that Russians attempted to interfere in our elections.\nUnlike previous administrations, my administration has and will continue to move aggressively to repeal any efforts \u2013 and repel \u2013 we will stop it, we will repel it \u2013 any efforts to interfere in our elections.\nWe\u2019re doing everything in our power to prevent Russian interference in 2018.\u201d\nAnyone who has studied President Trump knows he hates to admit a mistake.\nHis natural pattern is to move forward and ignore mistakes.\nFor him, this was a big correction (and as I noted the day before, it was an absolutely necessary one).\nPresident Trump then reminded everyone of the Obama administration\u2019s failures in dealing with Russian meddling in the election.\nPresident Trump noted that President Obama and his advisers had information that the Russians had been working to interfere in the election and they ignored it, because they thought Hillary Clinton was going to win.\nPresident Trump said: \u201cPresident Obama, along with (then-CIA Director John) Brennan and (then Director of National Intelligence James) Clapper and the whole group that you see on television now \u2013 probably getting paid a lot of money by your networks \u2013 they knew about Russia\u2019s attempt to interfere in the election in September, and they totally buried it.\nAnd as I said, they buried it because they thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win.\nIt turned out it didn\u2019t happen that way.\n\u201cBy contrast, my administration has taken a very firm stance \u2013 it\u2019s a very firm stance \u2013 on a strong action.\nWe\u2019re going to take strong action to secure our election systems and the process.\u201d\nThere are two key facts in this statement.\nFirst, the very people who have been loudest in attacking President Trump about his performance at the Helsinki summit are the people who failed to protect America from Russian meddling in 2016.\nThe very intensity and nastiness of former CIA Director Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence Clapper is an attempt to distract attention from their failure to protect America.\nIt was their duty in 2016 \u2013 not candidate Trump\u2019s.\nSecond, the Trump administration has been far tougher on Russia than President Obama ever dreamed of being.\nThe Trump administration is taking real actions designed to weaken Russia and force Putin to change his aggressive behavior.\nThe Trump administration has levied tough sanctions on Russia.\nAlso, President Trump\u2019s public lecture about Germany not buying natural gas from Russia was aimed at cutting Putin off from hard currency worth tens of billions of dollars and further weakening the Russian economy.\nFurthermore, President Trump\u2019s efforts to get our European allies to increase their defense spending has a direct impact on Putin.\nThe stronger NATO is, the less maneuvering room Russia has.\nBeyond pressuring our allies, consider these specific steps President Trump has taken against Russia:\nWhere President Obama refused to provide serious weapons to the Ukrainians to help them defend themselves (his response was weakness on a pathetic scale), President Trump has approved the sale of offensive weapons to enable the Ukrainians to increase the cost of Russian aggression.\nWhen the Russians used chemical weapons in Great Britain, President Trump joined our allies and expelled 60 Russian intelligence officers from the United States.\nWhen the Russians retaliated, the Trump administration closed the Russian consulate in Seattle.\nPresident Trump had previously shuttered the Russian consulate in San Francisco and smaller annexes in Washington and New York.\nMore than 100 Russian individuals and companies have been sanctioned for a variety of reasons.\nDespite the hysteria of the left, it is impossible to see the Trump administration as anything but firm in its dealing with Russia.\nNothing done in Helsinki made life easier for the Putin regime in its continued economic decay and diplomatic isolation due to the sanctions regime.\nFinally, a brief word about the strong language and vicious comments about the president.\nWe are in the early stages of a cultural civil war in which the left sees itself losing.\nThis is what led me to write my new New York Times best-selling book, \u201cTrump\u2019s America: The Truth About Our Nation\u2019s Great Comeback.\u201d With each passing month the radical-extremist wing of the Democratic Party dominates the progressive wing more and more.\nWith President Trump\u2019s nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, it was clear that anyone Trump nominated was going to be attacked.\nIn fact, the demonstrators protesting the nomination had signs for all four of the finalists and were instantly ready to oppose the president regardless of his choice.\nSimilarly, Obama-era national security officials seem determined to use the harshest possible language to attack President Trump.\nI think their strong words and hysteria are driven by their own guilt.\nWhatever the Russians did, they did while Brennan was director of the CIA, Clapper was director of national intelligence, and James Comey was head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nThese former officials attack Trump ferociously to hide their own failure and their own guilt.\nJust keep that in mind the next time you see one of them on TV.\nMy prediction is that President Trump will remain tough on Russia, and the Helsinki press conference will be seen as the aberration it was.\n", ["Repetition",

not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.\nFor for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.\nRender therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.\nThe first Scripture says:\nLet every soul be subject unto the higher powers.\nFor there is no

while crying out \u201cWe have no King but Caesar\u201d (John 19:15).\nDo these that teach such heresy not realize that every apostle, except John, was killed by hostile corrupt civil authorities opposed to their endeavors?\nChristians throughout history were imprisoned, tortured, or killed by corrupt civil authorities of all stripes for refusing to submit to their various, lawless policies and prohibitions.\nDid Christian martyrs violate God\u2019s principles of submission to authority?\nOf course, not.\nAlso, keep in mind that magistrates have limited and defined authority in civil matters.\nTake note that civil government is to be, and must be, a \u201cterror to good works.\u201d It has no power or authority to terrorize good works or good, law-abiding people.\nGod never gave them that authority and any, and all, government that oversteps the divine authority and its boundaries has no divine authority or protection.\nCivil government is a \u201cminister for God to thee for good\u201d (Romans 13:4).\nIt is not a minister of God for evil.\nCivil magistrates have a divine duty to \u201cexecute wrath upon him that doeth evil.\u201d Anyone who teaches that they have authority to execute wrath upon \"him that doeth good\u201d is ignorant and uneducated in their misleadings (1 John 4:6).\nTo tell Christians to submit to evil civil authority is teaching the opposite of what is true.\nCommon sense does come into play here.\nI ask, did Moses violate God's principle of submission when he was commanded by God, \u201cGo in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me\u201d (Exodus 9:1).\nAnd when Pharaoh refused, God plagued the Pharaoh and the Egyptians and set His children free.\nThink of this,

sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.\nThen an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,\nThat at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up:\nAnd whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.\nDaniel 3:3-6\nWhen they refused to submit to the tyrant, the furnace was heated up 7 times hotter so that the guards were consumed, only to have the fourth man, \u201clike the Son of man,\u201d show up to deliver them where the fire had no power over them, and not a hair of their heads was singed.\nIn the end, Only the corrupt king acknowledges the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.\n\u201cBlessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.\u201d Daniel 3:28\nDid Daniel violate God's principles of submission when he disobeyed the king's order to stop praying to any god but himself?\nKeep in mind that the punishment was that Daniel was thrown into a den of lions in which God sent forth an angel to protect him.\nHis accusers were then thrown into the den and devoured by the very lions that they meant to have devoured Daniel (Daniel 6).\nWhat of Jeremiah?\nWas he violating God's principles of submission when he was sent to preach repentance to the corrupt church and the corrupt kings?\nFor, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.\nJeremiah 1:18\nDon\u2019t forget about Amos, who was prophesying judgment upon the corrupt priests and the corrupt king of his day (Amos 7:10-16).\nWas that violating, or fulfilling God's principles and purposes?\nWhat of the New Testament?\nJohn the Baptist points out all of the evils of King Herod (Luke 3:19).\nWas this a violation of submission to civil government?\nNo, it was a rebuke to corruption in government to submit to the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and His laws.\nIs it a violation of submission to God's principles to keep preaching, \u201cRepent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins\u2026\u201d?\nAbsolutely not!\nThe corrupt Pharisees along with corrupt government did the opposite.\n\u201cBeing grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.\nAnd they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.\nHowbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.\nAnd it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes, and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.\nAnd when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?\nThen Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,\nIf we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;\nBe it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.\nThis is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.\nNeither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\nNow when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.\nAnd beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.\nBut when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,\nSaying, What shall we do to these men?\nfor that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.\nBut that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.\nAnd they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.\nBut Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.\nFor we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.\u201d Acts 4:2-20\nOr what of the account found in Acts 12:1-11, where the Lord sent an Angel to liberate Peter from the hands of tyrants.\n\u201cNow about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.\nAnd he killed James the brother of John with the sword.\nAnd because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also.\n(Then were the days of unleavened bread.)\nAnd when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.\nPeter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.\nAnd when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.\nAnd, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly.\nAnd his chains fell off from his hands.\nAnd the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals.\nAnd so he did.\nAnd he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.\nAnd he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.\nWhen they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.\nAnd when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.\u201d\nOver and over again, you can see that the Church was to stand in protest against the wicked that were at war with Christ (Revelation 12:17), in dealing with not only the corrupt and wicked priests, but also the corrupt and wicked in government.\nas well as those who submitted to such.\nIt is important for people to know the Scriptures (History), lest you find yourselves to be fighting against God (Acts 5:39).\nNowhere in Scripture can you find the Lord telling His children to submit to the wicked in disobedience to His Word.\nNowhere!\nFurthermore, the individual that wrote the article teaching people to submit to authorities might want to take the time to read Romans 12:21 before perverting and twisting Romans 13, so that the next time he will not be guilty of twisting Scripture the way that Satan twists Scripture.\n\u201cBe not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.\u201d\nArticle posted with permission from Sons Of Liberty Media\n", ["Repetition", "Flag-Waving", "Doubt",

Errand\nIt is said that the DOJ's recent settlement with start-up company Defense Distributed (DD) essentially deals a death blow to gun control advocates.\nDD, based in Austin, TX, was founded by 25-year-old Cody Wilson in 2013.\nThe company's main product is a \"gun fabricator\" called the Ghost Gunner.\nWith nothing but the Ghost Gunner, an internet connection, and some raw materials, anyone, anywhere can make an unmarked, untraceable gun in their home or garage.\nThe settlement states that 3D printing tutorials are approved \u201cfor public release (i.e.\nunlimited distribution) in any form.\u201d\nWilson created a ruckus in May 2013 when he announced his successful design of a plastic gun.\nIn just two days, 100,000 copies of the handgun blueprint were downloaded from Wilson\u2019s website.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be

grants you access to Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nThe most downloads came from Spain, followed by the U.S., Brazil and Germany.\nThe heavy downloading in Spain, Brazil and Germany likely reflected attempts to evade extremely restrictive handgun regulations in those countries.\nWithin days of the gun file being uploaded, the Obama State Department served Wilson with a letter threatening criminal prosecution for violating federal export controls.\nWilson immediately complied with the order, but there was no way to stop further downloading.\nWithin a week of the initial uploading, the file could be downloaded on the Internet from over 4,000 different computers around the world.\nIn 2015, the Second Amendment Foundation (SAF) and DD sued the State Department, arguing that \"sharing instructions on how to make guns with 3D printers counts as constitutionally protected speech.\nThis is an important victory for First Amendment rights.\"\nThe Justice Department\u2019s recent settlement with Wilson is very favorable to him, allowing Wilson to provide the printing instructions \u201cfor public release (meaning unlimited distribution) in any form.\u201d The government also compensated $40,000 of Wilson\u2019s legal costs.\nWhile this settlement is a victory for First Amendment rights, it will be difficult, if not impossible, for the government to regulate either the printers or the guns that are made with them.\nHow the government will stop people from obtaining these printers isn\u2019t exactly obvious.\nProposals to require background checks, mandatory serial numbers and even a registration process for printers are easily defeated.\nEven if printers are registered with the government, what is going to stop gangs from stealing them?\nAnd the designs for making your own printer have been available on the Internet for years.\n3D printers make the already extremely difficult job of controlling access to guns practically impossible.\nThe government is not going to be able to ban guns, and limits on the size of bullet magazines will be even more laughable than before.\nMany parts of a gun can be made on very inexpensive, plastic 3D printers or even from simple machine tools.\nIt will be even more difficult to impose background checks, which have proven quite useless anyway.\nThe government has been no more effective at stopping criminals from getting guns than at stopping them from obtaining drugs.\nThat isn\u2019t too surprising, as drug gangs are the source of both illegal drugs and guns.\nThis was a tough battle for the plaintiff's, SAF and DD.\nThey lost many lower court rulings.\nGun-control advocates believe that the government \"capitulated\" too soon.\nJ. Adam Skaggs, the chief counsel for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said the administration \u201ccapitulated in a case it had won at every step of the way.\nThis isn\u2019t a case where the underlying facts of the law changed.\nThe only thing that changed was the administration.\u201d\nThe concept of making guns with 3D printers in an age where just one year can render much technology obsolete shouldn't surprise anyone.\nNor should the fact that instructions for gun assembly are easily available for download over the internet.\nAt the click of a mouse, we can summon almost any information we could possibly need including instructions for making a bomb.\nThe ability to build an untraceable, unregistered gun is definitely a game changer.\nIt's difficult to see how \"ghost guns\" could ever be regulated by the government.\n", ["Exaggeration,Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling,Labeling", "Doubt"]], ["Things to Do in an Emergency: \u201cWhat\u2019s Your Trade?\u201d\nWell, it\u2019s been quite a couple of news weeks for the Catholic Church, hey?\nMcCarrick, Pineda/Maradiaga, Fr.\nJames Larkin getting the boot in Dublin for upholding Catholic teaching on abortion\u2026 I know some people are, to put it bluntly, freaking out.\nThe anger of the laity over the McCarrick situation is boiling over into the Twitter feed of the people we still call \u201cthe good bishops\u201d.\nBishop Thomas Tobin of Providence RI, - nicknamed the \u201cGood Tobin\u201d in contrast to the \u201cBad Tobin\u201d and FrancisCardinal, Joseph Tobin of Newark \u2013 got quite an earful when he tweeted the other day, \u201cDespite the egregious offenses of a few, and despite the faults and sins we all have, I\u2019m very proud of my brother bishops and I admire and applaud the great work they do everyday for Christ and His Church.\u201d\nThe replies haven\u2019t topped out yet, at 121, nearly all of them expressing outrage at this cavalier attitude toward the revelation that Cardinal McCarrick has been proven to be a life-long homosexual rapist and sexual predator, grooming and trapping young men and children into unwanted sexual contact; and that nearly the entire episcopate of the United States either colluded directly or kept quiet about it.\nIt\u2019s clear that even the \u201cgood bishops\u201d have simply no idea how close they are to being bodily chucked out of their own churches by furious mobs.\nAs I wrote elsewhere, since 2002, most Catholics know perfectly well, despite the lame whitewashing attempt, that \u201cthe US bishops gave themselves a pass\u201d on clerical sex abuse with the Dallas Charter \u201ca thing that brazenly shifted blame.\u201d And it seems that though they\u2019re still doing this, quite a few lay Catholics just aren\u2019t having it.\nWe are seeing the final slide, the expected and inevitable result of the last 100 years.\nThe Church was infiltrated, we know this, in the 19th century by some pretty dark forces, and they have finally come into the ascendancy and are showing themselves quite clearly for what they are.\nThe McCarrick news \u2013 and all the stuff swirling around it like the latest about Bishop Pineda and his connection to Pope Francis through Cardinal Maradiaga \u2013 has not come in contrast to this but as an intrinsic part of it.\nThe scandal of McCarrick is simply a toxic emission, a venting of the gasses that build up naturally around any rotting thing.\nRod Dreher[1] is doing excellent work compiling testimony from priests and others saying out loud at last what many of us had known for many years about McCarrick and his gang.\nIt has shown the world what Traditionalists have known, that it is emphatically NOT the result of one \u201cbad apple\u201d or even only a \u201cfew\u201d as the hapless \u201cconservative\u201d Bishop Tobin tried to claim on Twitter.\nThis is the result of a mass-collusion.\nAs our friend Steve Skojec put it the other day, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop pretending it\u2019s just the progressive element in the Church.\nThe \u2018conservatives\u2019 are complicit, too.\u201d In short, as it was during his days of glory, globe trotting on the dime of the State Department, hosting presidents for dinner and inviting John Paul II and Mother Theresa to tea, so it is now: McCarrick is the face of the New Paradigm.\nWhether he now has to go live in obscurity in some beach house in the Caymans, it will remain true: McCarrick is the \u201cNew Church.\u201d\nA point that Dreher\u2019s informants have brought up needs to be made emphatic: the homosexualist cabal that is currently reported to be dominant in the Catholic hierarchy (and don\u2019t imagine this is confined to the United States or even to the English speaking world) have a well documented methodology of mutual protection-and-threat that keeps the whole apparatus afloat.\nIn briefest and simplest possible terms, immoral or even illegal sexual activity is preferred because it leaves a man open to blackmail, to control through fear of exposure[2].\nWhen that blackmailing culture becomes ascendant, it will always reject the morally upright as too dangerous, too difficult to control.\nThis is why faithful seminarians are rejected and why faithful priests are harassed.\nAs Dreher reported,\nWhen predatory gay priests run seminaries, they select on a bias for gay candidates...\nGay seminarians who intend to be celibate, Sipe said, face tremendous pressure to have sex.\nIf they slip up even once, their failure will be noted, and shared\u2026 And they will be made to understand that their lapse is remembered.\nLater, as a priest, predators within the priesthood have that knowledge to hold over the heads of other gay priests, to keep them silent if they ever have the desire to blow whistles.\nWhen I was covering the scandal in the early 2000s, I spoke to several, unconnected heterosexual men \u2014 priests, former priests, seminarians \u2014 who said that gay seminary rectors or diocesan officials encouraged them to take female sexual partners, so that they too would be complicit in sexual secret-keeping, and therefore no longer [be] a potential danger.\nNothing in a system like that is a greater threat to the corrupt than men who are not corrupt.\nFor many priests, one might say all good priests, this is not a sustainable situation, to say the least.\nI\u2019ve had quite a few conversations with priests who are now asking how to deal with it.\nHow are they to continue to offer the sacraments in this situation?\nWhere are they to live?\nHow are they to maintain themselves?\nThese are the priests who did make it through this institutional gauntlet, who remain faithful now but are still under the control of these often grossly corrupt and evil men.\nAs men known to be incorruptible themselves, there is a big target painted on their backs.\nIn short, not only can a bad bishop harry a man out of his ministry, he has complete control over the priest\u2019s material life.\nThe bishop can, with the flick of a pen or a single phone call, render a priest homeless, penniless and jobless.\nAnd these, remember, are men, often well on in years, whose only education and employment training has likely been academic degrees in philosophy and theology, and whose only professional contacts are ecclesiastical.\nMoreover, because of the globalisation of the bishop-network, a man blackballed for his authentic Catholicity will be a pariah in every diocese in the world.\nAnd with the advent of Bergoglio in Rome, there are no more havens; as many of the former Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate have learned, the blackballing has gone global with this pontificate.\nHe will remain a pariah even among the so-called \u201cgood\u201d bishops who live in terror of the immense power of the cabal\u2026 (see above re: McCarrick & President Bush/John Paul II.)\nI have been hearing from priests who are saying in effect, \u201cWe\u2019re trapped in this situation and forced to remain silent because if we don\u2019t we\u2019ll not only be unable to function as priests, but we\u2019ll be homeless and penniless.\nWe\u2019re unemployable in any other field.\u201d And as much as we might be tempted to say, \u201cWell suck it up, this is for the good of souls,\u201d the reality is that these are not small considerations.\nMany priests are getting older \u2013 many of them with health issues \u2013 and a man who has already given 20 or 30 years of his life to the Church is faced with a practical impossibility if he finds himself blacklisted.\nOf course there are some who don\u2019t fit this mould; there are a lot of second careers in the priesthood and plenty of people go into seminary after some years in the normal workforce and can go back to it at need.\nSome of the men now coming forward with complaints against McCarrick, who left the priesthood over their experiences, have gone on to have normal, healthy working lives.\nBut I think honestly most priests are in this corner and they know it and so do their bishops.\nI think a young man goes forward in great faith, spends ten to fifteen years studying philosophy and theology - fields that have almost no application in the workforce outside academia or the Church - with the honest, and frankly fair, expectation of a lifetime of employment and a safety net at the end.\nAs one of them said to me, \u201cThe old arrangement was, \u2018Remain faithful, do the work, and we will look after you.\nWe\u2019ll house, feed and clothe you and look after your retirement.\u2019 The new arrangement is a perversion of that: \u2018Keep quiet and go along with it all and you\u2019ll be fine, but step an inch out of line and we\u2019ll destroy you.\u2019\u201d\nSo what do we do?\nThe Old Paradigm is destroyed and going along with the New Paradigm is a guarantee of destruction for yourself and everyone else.\nAs we saw in Ireland this week, the Purge has started.\nIt\u2019s not enough to simply demand that a priest continue in his ministry no matter what.\nWe need to start working together with faithful priests \u2013 while there still are some \u2013 to help them create practical material alternatives.\nIf we who still love the Church want priests to be faithful, and even to start denouncing the evil and corruption they see, we are going to have to help them create a modicum of independence and security in which to do it.\nThe other day the American conservative writer, John Zmirak, wrote a sound suggestion on Twitter that I think it\u2019s time we all started taking seriously.\nIn response to the continued outrages of both \u201cgood\u201d and bad bishops, Zmirak suggested establishing \u201can escrow fund in each scandal-plagued diocese, where laymen [can] deposit the funds they would have donated to [the] local church, until [a] new bishop [is] appointed.\u201d\nI responded: \u201cAnd the money could be used to purchase properties to house faithful priests punished by their bishops for refusing the New Paradigm.\nWe could even perhaps buy a few convents so contemplative nuns could continue to pray in peace, without harassment from the evil men in Rome.\u201d\nI am hearing lately from laymen who are starting to talk about setting up financial structures to ensure that the authentic Catholic life can be maintained through what is obviously soon to be a general collapse of the institution.\nThis would mean independent non-profit foundations that could build or buy church buildings, convents and even schools and provide salaries for priests and other staff.\nI started thinking about this recently when I received a note from a reader with a link to an online petition from Germany, addressed to the German bishops [!!!]\n\u201cbegging\u201d those manifestly evil and apostate men not to close a famous and ancient monastic house.\nI responded that this was going about things the wrong way.\nCatholics are going to have to get their heads out of the mindset that they are helpless petitioners, \u201cbegging\u201d the hierarchy to maintain the Faith.\nFirst of all, it only gives them a frisson of pleasure to see us groveling and begging for mercy.\nLet\u2019s not give them that, OK?\nThere\u2019s already enough \u201cfrissons of pleasure\u201d in their lives.\nSecond, it\u2019s simply not going to work.\nIn Germany, in the US, in Canada, in Italy, in Britain\u2026 throughout the Church in the 1st world, and in much of it elsewhere, the men in charge of the \u201cinstitutional Church\u201d \u2013 that is, whose names are on the bank accounts \u2013 are dedicated to the destruction of everything we want to preserve.\nThe wolves are now looking with ravening eyes at the faithful.\nThey are, in short, our enemies.\nThey\u2019ve become so by making themselves the enemies of Christ and His Holy Church.\nThey know it and it\u2019s time we stopped imagining otherwise.\nThe other suggestion I have is for young men interested in the priesthood to fortify themselves not only spiritually but in the material sphere.\nThere\u2019s one big vulnerability we can guard against pretty easily.\nNo one should be facing penury and permanent unemployment because he\u2019s a faithful Catholic.\nWe should never be letting any young man go into any diocesan seminary without being a property owner.\nHe should own a house or stand to inherit one.\nFamilies have to come to see this as a duty to the child and to the Church.\nAnd more than that, the potential priest needs to have job skills that have nothing to do with the priesthood.\nAmong the working classes there is a bias against intellectual work.\nBut most working class people have a pretty sensible attitude towards ambitions in academia: get something under your belt you can fall back on.\nHow many philosophy PhDs can build himself a bookshelf?\nChange the oil in a car?\nRewire a house?\nThe standard clich\u00e9 of young people with useless academic degrees working at Starbucks has become so common it\u2019s not even worth memeing anymore.\nHow many young men do we foresee being forced out of seminary for having the wrong \u201csexual orientation\u201d?\nEvery one of those guys needs to be able to snap his fingers in the face of the rector and walk straight into a decent job, based not on any recommendation from a corrupt bishop, but on his solid skills.\nAmong the white collar classes there is a bias against blue collar work, but the trades are crying out for skilled men and a trade school diploma in fixing tractors is a lot cheaper and a lot faster to get than a university degree.\nThat\u2019s an economic asset that we can\u2019t afford to turn up our well-educated noses at.\nDon't miss Hilary White's next article in the July 31 Print Edition of The Remnant Newspaper; Subscribe today!\nIt reminds me of a discussion I had some years ago with the prior of a Benedictine monastery that is attracting a lot of young vocations.\nOne kid wanted to join and told me they had recommended he go to some college or other to study philosophy first.\nThis college, apparently, waives much of the tuition and gives work studies to people going for the priesthood and religious life so they can avoid the student loan trap.\nThis is fine, good idea.\nBut I asked him what he knew how to do.\n\u201cCan you fix a bathroom pipe?\nDo you know anything about what to feed a sheep or how to care for a cow?\nCan you drive a tractor?\u201d This nice kid, who certainly does have a vocation, could read books and look things up on the internet and write a pretty mean paper on Thomas Aquinas, but not a lot else.\nThere is going to have to be a shift in attitude in our remaining faithful institutions.\nDoes a monastery really need all of its members to have PhDs in philosophy and theology?\nWouldn\u2019t it also be useful to have an electrician, a plumber, a carpenter, a cook, someone who knows how to fix a car or a tractor?\nOr for that matter, a certified accountant or an investment banker?\nIf you insist on having people with degrees, maybe a degree in agriculture would be a good fit for a big monastic foundation with a lot of land like, say, Clear Creek or that new Carmelite place in Nebraska.\nI think this is the time we are going to have to start overcoming our class snobbery.\nYoung men with ambitions for the priesthood are going to have to tuck away employability and an independent financial foundation, in the same way people used to tuck money away against a rainy day.\nSimply put, they\u2019ve got to stop being materially dependent on the hierarchy.\nThis vulnerability is a gun to their heads in this time.\nThe next kid who says anything to me about wanting to enter the diocesan priesthood, I\u2019m going to ask, \u201cHow sound is your investment portfolio?\u201d The next candidate for religious life, I\u2019ll ask, \u201cGreat!\nWhat\u2019s your trade?\nWhat do you have to fall back on?\u201d\nI\u2019m given to understand that some houses of the Congregation of the Oratory ask candidates to come with an independent income, which, given what we\u2019re seeing elsewhere doesn\u2019t sound like a bad idea.\nPerhaps Catholic financial advisors could be encouraged to set up a programme to teach young men how to create a sound financial footing with investments.\nMeanwhile, we must refocus our energy on the Faith itself, instead of the physical and even canonical structures that house it.\nThat monastery in Germany is lost.\nThose bishops want the property and they\u2019ll get it.\nWhat the group of laymen should be doing, instead of petitioning that it be saved, is finding a place where the nuns can live their charism of religious life without episcopal harassment.\nBishops won\u2019t protect and support good priests?\nThen it\u2019s up to us.\nThe Vatican wants to force all religious congregations into the pants-wearing, Marxist anti-nun, LCWR pattern?\nWe\u2019re not helpless.\nWe start buying convent buildings and start a fund to support the nun-refugees.\nOur goal must be preserving the precious treasure, the Deposit of the Faith, the sacramental life, the great charisms and artifacts of the religious life.\nI am reminded of what the curators of the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg did in the face of the advancing German army.\nThey took down, packed up and hid the art treasures, some of the greatest in the world.\nOver a million precious works of art were sent on trains to be hidden in the Urals.\nTwo trains got away to safety, but one was still there when the Germans surrounded the city and began the siege.\nThe museum\u2019s website tells us:\n\u201cDespite starvation and severely cold temperatures, the Museum continued its preservational functions.\nWith only a skeleton staff left behind, it was difficult to protect the vast buildings and their sumptuous interiors against snow, wind and rain.\nEquipped with first-aid kits, wearing helmets and gloves, the Museum air wardens cleared away heaps of broken bricks and the remains of charred flooring after each bomb hit the building; they helped dig out the living and the dead and bandage the wounded after raids in the surrounding area.\nTwelve air-raid shelters were fitted out in the basements of the Museum complex and until the first evacuations were made in March 1942 there were 12,000 people housed there permanently, among them the Museum Director, celebrated Academician Iosif Orbeli.\u201d \u201cHermitage staff both in Sverdlovsk and in Leningrad acted as museum attendants, continuing their scholarly activity and lecturing in hospitals, holding conferences, writing

and others are asking some very important questions now about the activities of the men McCarrick is known to have mentored, one of whom is currently making interesting headlines as Pope Francis\u2019 Cardinal Prefect of the new Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life, and as the primary organiser of the upcoming World Meeting of Families in his native Dublin.\nIt should probably be noted that up to the time he left over a \u201cdifference of opinion\u201d with the group\u2019s leadership, Cardinal Kevin Farrell as also deeply involved in the Legionaries of Christ.\nHe joined in 1966, was ordained in \u201978, and was quickly appointed to a high-ranking position as general director with responsibility for seminaries and schools of the Legionaries of Christ in Italy, Spain and Ireland until 1983.\nThis period was at the peak of the power of the grotesquely corrupt Fr.\nMaciel, for whom it has been shown ALL the Legion\u2019s leadership was covering.\nThe Farrell family\u2019s involvement in the Legion continues with his brother, Bishop Brian Farrell, who ordained 20 new priests to the questionable-but-officially-reformed community in 2015.\nA recent post to the official Regnum Christi website shows that Cardinal Kevin is still close enough to the Legion-related \u201clay\u201d organisation to hire dicastery staff from their ranks.\nAfter he left the Legion, Kevin Farrell joined the diocesan clergy in Washington DC and became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the archbishop, Cardinal Wuerl.\nSo close is he to McCarrick that Farrell\u2019s coat of arms, as Elizabeth Yore reported in these pages, is not much more than a tribute to his belatedly-disgraced mentor.\nSo, someone in a journalistic capacity might want to be asking a few questions about these things too.\n[2] It should also be noted that in his book, The Dictator Pope, historian Henry Sire documented that this is how Jorge Bergoglio has always operated, collecting bad men around him and controlling them with a masterful combination of threats and rewards.\nThe natural question, \u201cWhy does Pope Francis keep such bad men around him?\u201d is now easy to answer.\n", ["Thought-terminating_Cliches",

as well.\nFormer Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, concurred with Hemingway arguing that by any standard Trump has been far tougher on Russia than Obama was.\nFirst, the very people who have been loudest in attacking President Trump about his performance at the Helsinki summit are the people who failed to protect America from Russian meddling in 2016.\nThe very intensity and nastiness of former CIA Director Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence Clapper is an attempt to distract attention from their failure to protect America.\nIt was their duty in 2016 \u2013 not

Russia and force Putin to change his aggressive behavior.\nThe Trump administration has levied tough sanctions on Russia.\nAlso, President Trump\u2019s public lecture about Germany not buying natural gas from Russia was aimed at cutting Putin off from hard currency worth tens of billions of dollars and further weakening the Russian economy.\nFurthermore, President Trump\u2019s efforts to get our European allies to increase their defense spending has a direct impact on Putin.\nThe stronger NATO is, the less maneuvering room Russia has.\nBeyond pressuring our allies, consider these specific steps President Trump has taken against Russia: Where President Obama refused to provide serious weapons to the Ukrainians to help them defend themselves (his response was weakness on a pathetic scale), President Trump has approved the sale of offensive weapons to enable the Ukrainians to increase the cost of Russian aggression.\nWhen the Russians used chemical weapons in Great Britain, President Trump joined our allies and expelled 60 Russian intelligence officers from the United States.\nWhen the Russians retaliated, the Trump administration closed the Russian consulate in Seattle.\nPresident Trump had previously shuttered the Russian consulate in San Francisco and smaller annexes in Washington and New York.\nMore than 100 Russian individuals and companies have been sanctioned for a variety of reasons.\nDespite the hysteria of the left, it is impossible to see the Trump administration as anything but firm in its dealing with Russia.\nNothing done in Helsinki made

abuse of minors and seminarians over the last 60 years continues to enrage the laity.\nWe are no longer Shocked, just fed up.\nLet\u2019s start with the Cardinal who will lead the upcoming Synod, none other than Cardinal Kevin Farrell, Prefect of the Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life.\nAs the DC roommate and protege of Ted McCarrick, Farrell so respected McCarrick, the Molester, that he fashioned his Coat of Arms as a tribute to Uncle Ted.\nFarrell\u2019s pathetic and laughable defense \u201cI never knew anything about McCarrick\u201d video highlights the continuing conspiracy of denial by the U.S. Catholic hierarchy.\nUndoubtedly, Farrell as the head of this Synod chose his dear friend gay friendly, Fr.\nJames Martin, S.J.\nto keynote the Synod.\nFarrell\u2019s graciously offers notorious praise for Martin\u2019s new book, Building a Bridge (to hell, ed.)\nexposes his obvious underlying homosexual agenda and aura of the upcoming Synod:\n\u201cA welcome and much-needed book that will help bishops, priests, pastoral associates, and all church leaders more compassionately minister to the LGBT community.\nIt will also help LGBT Catholics feel more at home in what is, after all, their church.\u201d\nWhat merciful praise for Martin\u2019s book, Cardinal Farrell!\nContrary to the theme of mercy and compassion to LGBTs, it appears that your mentor, McCarrick set out to groom and grow an LGBT community.\nClearly, you and Fr.\nMartin have much in common since you both claimed you were \u201cshocked\u201d by the McCarrick allegations.\nExplain to Catholics why would you headline a homosexual affirming speaker at a Synod for youth and seminarians?\nIn case you haven\u2019t been reading the McCarrick headlines or noticing the plunging mass attendance and collections, Catholics don\u2019t trust their boys around priests and are furious that their seminarians are subjected to unrelenting homosexual sexual harassment.\nMcCarrick is the last straw.\nAll credibility is lost.\nThe October Synod is yet another example of Church leaders exploiting Catholic youth for their own personal power agenda and selfish motives.\nBergoglio\u2019s five year plan is nearly complete.\nCatholics must shed their trust and naivety in the papacy and bishops\u2019 conference.\nDare, if you will, to read the thrill, the excitement and anticipated results of the Synod in the radical New Ways Gay Catholic Ministry article, entitled, Youth Synod Document shows Vatican evolution on LGBT Topics.\nThe article highlights the New Ways excitement over the shift in the Vatican approach to the LGBT issues at the Synod:\n\u201cAnother significant development is the acknowledgement that LGBT people have a desire to be part of the church.\nIn one section, the document states: \u201csome LGBT youth \u2026 wish to benefit from greater closeness and experience greater care from the Church.\u201d \u201cThis acknowledgement is a welcome change from the hierarchy\u2019s traditional rhetoric that suggests LGBT people are opposed to religion.\nAs New Ways Ministry knows from over 40 years of pastoral work with the LGBT community, LGBT Catholics have a deep spirituality, often forged by remarkable journeys overcoming rejection, alienation, and marginalization.\nLGBT Catholics have stayed a part of the church, despite statements and actions which have offended and hurt them.\u201d\nThe New Ways article highlights the efforts of Cardinal Kevin Farrell and his Vatican cronies to promote the LGBT agenda for the upcoming Synod:\n\u201cA third development is that the document shows that Vatican officials paid attention to concerns about LGBT issues which were raised by youth at a pre-synod meeting in Rome during March of this year, and also from youth around the world who made their views known to the Vatican online.\u201d\nAnd what of the infamous Instrumentum Laboris, drafted by the crafty Cardinal Baldisseri, Secretary General of the Synod of Bishops, noteworthy of the infamous First Synod on the Family?\nKnown for his manipulative polls and magical modernistic results, Baldisseri infamously stated that \u201cdogma has its own evolution.\u201d Baldisseri stayed true to his modernist form and agenda and to the delight of the New Ways Ministry, he announced at the Vatican press conference that his office is using for the first time ever the LGBT acronym to refer to gay people in a spirit of inclusion.\nLest there be any doubt about the secret agenda and outcome of this Synod, Cardinal Baldisseri raises the exclusion rainbow flag.\nBaldisseri notes that the upcoming Synod is to \u201cmake the entire Church aware of its important mission to accompany every young person, none excluded.\u201d\nThis papacy is awash in the prissy, pop psycho speak, jargon of accompaniment, listening, and dialogue dazzling the media with empty tropes and luring the uncatechized into its globalist mantra of one world new age religion.\nNot surprisingly, Baldisseri never once mentions that dreaded word, dogma in the Instrumentum Laboris, but effuses about accompaniment 136 times!\nThis doltish and dimwitted document wreaks of psycho babble, insults the intelligence of young people, and will destroy the future of the Church.\nWelcome to the dumbing down of the Catholic Faith by the St. Gallen Mafia and their don, Jorge Bergoglio.\nThis Synod will exploit the youth and seminarians, just like Ted McCarrick.\nThe handwriting is all over the 37 foot Vatican wall.\nThe time to take a stand against this radical hijacking of Holy Mother Church is now.\nExpose and rout every last predator.\nPurge every homosexual from its clerical ranks.\n#StopTheSynod.\nIt has all the markings of a Gay Pride Rally.\n__________________________________________\nElizabeth Yore is an attorney and international child rights advocate who has investigated clergy sex abuse cases.\n", ["Repetition",

contend with constituted reality.\nEver since Adam and Eve committed the Original Sin, every living creature is subject to it.\nEvery one of us is born on Death Row and lives out his allotted lifespan in its shadow without hope of reprieve.\nGod made that clear when He told Adam that \u201cin what day soever\u201d he preferred his own will above his Creator\u2019s, \u201cthou shalt die the death,\u201d condemning him sooner or later to \u201creturn to the earth out of which thou wast taken: for dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt return\u201d (Gen. 3:19).\nIn other words, there has always been a death penalty.\nGod instituted it, and He was the first to impose it, embedding it in the very fabric of natural law.\nWhen Cain took it upon himself to inflict death on his brother Abel \u201cin the field,\u201d he soon learned that God furthermore reserved the exercise of this right to himself alone.\nCain is told, \u201cWhat hast thou done?\nThe voice of thy brother\u2019s blood crieth to me from the earth,\u201d and God curses him for his presumption by dooming him to homelessness and unproductive labor.\nWhen Cain complains that being a \u201cvagabond .\n.\n.\non the earth, every one therefore that findeth me, shall kill me,\u201d God laid down that \u201cwhoever shall kill Cain shall be punished sevenfold,\u201d setting a mysterious identifying mark on him to protect him from the vengeance of others.\nThe Fifth Commandment later delivered to Moses, \u201cThou shalt not kill,\u201d therefore dates from adamic times, when it operated as God\u2019s exclusive prerogative, allowing no exceptions.\nAlthough men certainly continued to kill one another in a society which in fact became so wicked \"that all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil at all times,\" they did so as murderers, outside God's law without legal right.\nOnly after the Flood, when Noah and his sons set about repopulating the earth, did God delegate to human society His exclusive authority to impose the death penalty for just cause.\nHe told Noah, \u201cFor I will require the blood of your lives at the hand of every beast, and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man, and of his brother, will I require the life of man.\nWhosoever shall shed man\u2019s blood, his blood shall be shed: for man was made to the image of God.\u201d In other words, from that point in history lawful killing in atonement for taking the life of another is sanctioned by God.\nAfter the great theophany on Sinai, Moses codified the death penalty as part of the old law of talion, which in strict justice required \u201clife for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot\u201d (Deut.\n19:21).\nThe supreme penalty was imposed not only for murder, but for many other serious offenses: for adultery, rape, sodomy, kidnapping, for striking or cursing parents, for sacrificing a child to Moloch.\nIdolatry, fortune-telling, acting as a medium, preaching apostasy or attempting in any way to entice another from the faith were also punishable by death, as was blasphemy, an offense considered so heinous that the Law specified, \u201cHe that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dying let him die: all the multitude shall stone him, whether he be a native or a stranger\u201d (Lev.\n24:16).\nDeath was also decreed for refusing to accept the decision of the priests in a legal case, and an incorrigible son could be put to death on the testimony of his parents before the proper court.\nA priest\u2019s daughter convicted of fornication was burned to death (Lev.\n21:9), but usually the sentence was carried out by stoning, in which the whole community took part as evidence that no private parties were authorized to execute a criminal, but only society as a whole, after due judgment.\nEveryone was furthermore responsible for the atonement due to God for a crime whose evil consequences would otherwise have affected them all: \u201cThe hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to kill him, and afterwards the hands of the rest of the people; that thou mayest take away the evil out of the midst of thee\u201d (Deut.\n17:7).\nThe Law read, \u201cDefile not the land of your habitation which is stained with the blood of the innocent: neither can it otherwise be expiated, but by his blood that hath shed the blood of another\u201d (Num.\n35:33).\nIn order to emphasize the fact that it is God, and not man, who is always the principal party to be avenged, provision was made for a heifer to be killed as propitiation in the case of an unsolved murder whose perpetrator could not be found (Deut.\n20:1-9).\nAfter all, it is not the injury to relatives or any other human consideration that makes homicide the serious sin that it is, but as God Himself pointed out to Noah, it is the fact that \u201cman was made to the image of God\u201d that makes an assault on him tantamount to an assault on God.\nIt is therefore to God, and not to His creatures that reparation is primarily due.\nThis point was brought out by Pope Pius XII in an address to Italian Catholic jurists on May 12, 1954, when he said:\nA penalty is the reaction required by law and justice in response to a fault: penalty and fault are action and reaction.\nOrder violated by a culpable act demands the reintegration and re-establishment of the disturbed equilibrium .\n.\n.\n.\nA word must be said on the full meaning of penalty.\nMost of the modern theories of penal law explain penalty and justify it in the final analysis as a means of protection, that is, defense of the community against criminal undertakings, and at the same time an attempt to bring the offender to observance of the law.\nIn those theories, the penalty can include sanctions such as the diminution of some goods guaranteed by law, so as to teach the guilty to live honestly, but those theories fail to consider the expiation of the crime committed, which penalizes the violation of the law as the prime function of penalty .\n.\n.\n.\nIn the metaphysical order, penalty is a consequence of dependence on the supreme will, dependence which exists in the deepest recesses of created being.\nIf it is ever necessary to hold back the revolt of the free being and re-establish the violated law, it is when that is required by the supreme Judge and supreme Justice.\nToday the death penalty is imposed ever more rarely, even in cases of proven premeditated murder.\nDespite the fact that it was instituted by God Himself, growing numbers of Catholics actually consider it immoral.\nJohn Paul II, stopping just short of declaring it wrong in principle, has declared that it should be imposed very seldom, if ever.\nBut doesn\u2019t admitting the penalty in principle demand that it be put into practice?\nIn the U.S., following the lead of the late Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago and like minded prelates won to the new man-centered conciliar religion, the faithful are beginning to equate abortion, nuclear war and capital punishment as common \u201cthreats to the sacredness of human life\u201d without any reference whatever to the innocence or guilt involved.\nIf they are aware that the Church has upheld from Apostolic times the right to use force in self-defense, to kill in a just war and to inflict the death penalty on those duly judged guilty of serious crime, they now apparently subscribe to the notion propagated by Dei Verbum at the Second Vatican Council that the unchanging Catholic \u201ctradition which comes from the Apostles\u201d actually \u201cdevelops in the Church\u201d and keeps pace with changing times (II,8).\nThe circumstances pertaining to our day would therefore dictate a reassessment of the death penalty, which the new man-centered theology insists on viewing almost exclusively from the standpoint of the criminal and human society rather than from God\u2019s.\nAt the same time, there is more and more discussion about society\u2019s responsibility for having produced criminals in the first place, together with our moral obligation to rehabilitate them rather than to wreak what is now considered a form of fruitless, guilty \u201cvengeance\u201d on them.\nThe idea that man is by nature good and perfectible is allowed to override all documented evidence that hardened criminals are in fact almost impossible to rehabilitate and that those handed life sentences rarely repent of their wrongdoing.\nAccording to one widely held opinion, the death penalty has proved to be no effective deterrent to crime in any case, and should be discarded as impractical.\nWhat proof of this can possibly be offered?\nHow can we know?\nDeterrence from evil is not the primary purpose of meting out punishment in any case, yet Scripture attests to deterrence as an important side effect of any penalty.\nTo a man proven to have given false witness against another, Deuteronomy laid down, \u201cThey shall render to him as he meant to do to his brother.\n.\n.\nthat others hearing may fear and may not dare to do such things.\nThou shalt not pity him, but shalt require life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot\u201d (Deut.\n19:19-21).\nAnd the Preacher notes that when \u201csentence is not speedily pronounced against the evil, the children of men commit evils without any fear\u201d (Eccles.\n8:11).\nTo illustrate how shallow Catholic thinking on the death penalty has become and how far it has deviated from the age-old doctrine of the Church, a priest of a presumably traditional Catholic Fraternity writes in answer to a query addressed to him on the subject by saying:\nThe death penalty is based on the common teachings of theologians, but is not itself a declared dogma.\nTherefore it is not permissible to call those who hold it is, immoral heretics.\nTo approach this as a dogmatic teaching is imprudent.\nThose who argue for its abolition do not necessarily put society in danger considering possibilities of penal systems.\nThose, however, who maintain its continued use often see it more as a tool for revenge.\nPlease consider that in anger and tragedy, the desire for revenge usually overrides reason and an honest answering of the question \u201cmust this person\u2019s life be taken to preserve society?\u201d The desire for swift and firm convictions has sent many to death who never deserved such a punishment, nor was such a punishment truly necessary for the safety of society.\nI do not believe the death penalty is necessary in 90 percent of the cases where it is applied.\nThus to call for a moratorium .\n.\n.\nis not unjust or incorrect.\nThat the death penalty can become an instrument of revenge, and that unjust sentences are sometimes handed down can be dismissed as irrelevant to the argument.\nGiven the fallen human condition, such injustices are bound to occur in any judicial system, and everyone agrees that they should be ruthlessly remedied.\nWhat is not irrelevant is that the author of the letter falls headlong into the very error Pius XII warns against.\nConsidering the physical safety of society as the only real reason for executing a criminal, he feels the death penalty can now be safely discarded, allegedly on the grounds that we now have at our disposal many better ways of protecting people from him.\nThat the penalty is due primarily as expiation to God in justice, and only secondarily to man has been lost sight of altogether.\nThe supernatural dimension of the punishment as an agent for the spiritual good of both society and the criminal is furthermore not only not addressed, but treated as non-existent.\nThis first appeared in The Remnant nearly 20 years ago.\nIsn't it time to subscribe to the 'paper of record' for the traditional Catholic counterrevolution?\nThe source of this kind of materialistic thinking in the Church is not hard to trace.\nAccording to statistics published in the National Review for September 16, 1983, out of 9,140 murders committed in the U.S. in 1960 just before the Council, 56 persons were executed.\nIn 1965, the year the Council closed, although the tally of murders had risen to 9,850, only 7 were executed.\nIn the decade from 1967 to 1977 a moratorium was declared during which not one single execution took place.\nAt its close the number of murders had more than doubled, and in any six month period, more Americans were being murdered than those executed during the whole course of the century.\nAt this point, although the murder rate has continued to rise dramatically, executions continue to be rare.\nMany nations, notably England, France, Sweden, South Africa and our neighbors Canada and Mexico, have abolished the death penalty altogether.\nWhether or not the U. S. will follow suit and outlaw it nationally still remains to be seen.\nWhat leaps to the eye from the mounting statistics is that decline in the exercise of the death penalty has kept close pace with decline in the Faith and church attendance.\nIt is sober fact that death sentences were liberally handed out in the heyday of Christendom, when the Faith was strong and governments legislated with an eye to the spiritual welfare of citizens whose sights were primarily on future bliss in heaven.\nIn modern times, which find the Church strictly separated from the state on principle and denied any active part in civil government, secularism has become the state religion, directing legislation exclusively to temporal objectives.\nIt is only to be expected that materialists\u2014for whom the immortal soul does not exist and who believe that this present life of the senses on earth is the only one man has\u2014should be reluctant to punish anyone by killing him.\nIn their eyes this means total extinction, a penalty certainly in excess of any transgression of which he may be guilty.\nNot even God completely obliterates a human existence, not even for the most odious sins, for He made the human soul immortal and hell eternal.\n(It might be argued, however, that if the criminal is thought to have to have totally terminated his victim, why not do the same to him?)\nIn the days of Christendom, condemned criminals were given every opportunity to make their peace with God, in many cases the date of execution being delayed in order to accomplish this purpose.\nJustice was served, but not at the expense of charity, and there was no question of taking vengeance on the culprit.\nNor was the idea of \u201crehabilitation\u201d with possible re-entry into society ever entertained where crimes deserving death were concerned.\nIt has been noted by prison chaplains in our century that swift execution in most cases leads to admission of guilt and sincere repentance, whereas those who receive life sentences or suffer long delays are likely to maintain their innocence in hopes of a parole and eventually die in their sins.\nAs it is, the death penalty as administered by society must be viewed against the backdrop of divine revelation if it is to make any real sense.\nWhen Catholic society puts a man to death, it terminates only his temporal life on earth, catapulting him into eternity for his final judgment before almighty God.\nSuffering the penalty not only allows the criminal to render expiation to God and to society, but if accepted in Christ\u2019s grace with due repentance, it preserves his soul from hell and eliminates much of his purgatory.\nIf his contrition is perfect, it\u2019s conceivable that he could go straight to heaven!\nIn any case, neither he nor society is any longer burdened with the guilt of his wrongdoing.\nAs Michel Martin pointed out in an article in Rome et d\u2019Ailleurs for September-October 1983, \u201cThe truth is that the problem of the death penalty is insoluble except from a Christian point of view.\u201d That it figured so prominently in Christian societies is due to the fact that, in the order of charity, atonement to God was sought above any atonement due to man, and the spiritual welfare of citizens above their physical well-being.\nModern secularized society assumes that physical extinction is the worst thing that can happen to a human being, whereas the faith teaches that eternal damnation is incalculably worse.\nIn the context of the faith, the importance of a man\u2019s present short life on earth cannot be compared with his future endless existence in heaven.\n+++\nAs we have seen, the death penalty has a very long history.\nDating from its institution by God in Eden to its delegation after the Flood to men who would wield it in God\u2019s name, it has threaded its way without interruption through the fabric of human civilizations until these latter days.\nOne might expect that after the Incarnation, when God became man and replaced the Old Testament\u2019s law of talion based on strict justice with a new dispensation based on love and grace, the death penalty could be safely abolished as outmoded.\nConverts to the prevailing conciliar religion and its \u201cNew Pentecost\u201d would in fact argue in this wise, perhaps citing the Council\u2019s famous declaration in Gaudium et Spes that, \u201cThanks to the experience of past ages ...the nature of man himself is more clearly revealed and new roads to truth are opened,\u201d and the world now has \u201ca keener awareness of human dignity\u201d ( 44, 73).\nFar from obliterating the death penalty, however, the Incarnation only laid bare its deepest significance, hidden from the beginning.\nAs the new dispensation\u2019s foremost theologian, St. Paul would declare, the old penalty remained very much in force: \u201cAlmost all things, according to the law, are cleansed with blood: and without the shedding of blood there is no remission.\u201d It is still \u201cappointed for men once to die, and after this the judgment\u201d (Heb.\n9: 22,27), but now with the possibility of eternal bliss in heaven.\nThis possibility is owed, furthermore, to a death by one of the cruelest means ever devised, unjustly inflicted on one supremely innocent Man who was God, in a miscarriage of human justice beyond any the world could ever have imagined.\nWhen God set the death penalty in Eden He pronounced it on Himself, to be carried out in the fullness of time through the malicious free wills of his own creatures.\nThe Cross which was its instrument is the very sign of Christianity, the only means of salvation.\nNot even from the Cross did Christ decry the death penalty, either for himself or for the two thieves crucified with Him.\nIt would continue to be dealt out to men by other men on earth, with only one significant change: Henceforth it would be administered under the authority of the glorified man who is Christ the King, as part and parcel of that universal power \u201cin heaven and on earth\u201d which He received from His Father (Matt.\n28:18) after His Resurrection.\nFrom that point on it is Christ who delegates the divine authority to punish by killing, and both Scripture and tradition testify that it is lawfully wielded by those to whom He entrusts the temporal sword in His Kingdom.\nAs He told Pontius Pilate at the time of His trial, \u201cThou shouldst not have any power against me, unless it were given thee from above\u201d (John 19:10).\nPope Leo XIII re-affirmed this truth in Sapientiae Christianae in 1890, when he declared that \u201ctrue and legitimate authority is devoid of sanction unless it proceed from God the supreme Ruler and Lord of all.\nThe Almighty alone can commit power to a man over his fellow men.\u201d Even though they may be unaware of the true source of their power, it is always the duty of legitimate authorities to ensure public order by punishing evil-doers, by death if appropriate.\nAs St. Paul said:\nTherefore he that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God, and they that resist purchase to themselves eternal damnation.\nFor rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil.\n.\n.\nFor he is the minister of God to thee for good.\nBut if thou do that which is evil, fear: for he beareth not the sword in vain.\nFor he is the minister of God: and avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil (Rom.\n13:2-4).\nSufficient of itself to expiate every sin which the children of Adam could ever commit, the execution of the Man-God nevertheless did not abolish the penalty of death.\nIt continues to be the wages of sin (Rom 6:23), and men must still submit to it sooner or later by forfeiting their lives, either willingly or unwillingly.\nA share in making restitution for sin was thus accorded to all of us, for although our Lord\u2019s ignominious death removed from us the guilt of the original transgression through Baptism, it did not remove its effects.\nThese were allowed to remain as restraints on men who, now raised to a new supernatural existence, were capable of committing incalculably more grievous sins than heretofore.\nAs for the death penalty, it remains the inescapable consequence of our fallen nature and is of the highest utility in deterring us from following our hereditary inclination to evil.\nWhat Christ did was to sanctify the death penalty, transforming it into a sacrament of life for those who believe.\nAs St. Paul declared, \u201cDeath is swallowed up in victory.\nO death, where is thy victory?\nO death, where is thy sting?.\n.\n.\nFor by a man came death, and by a man the resurrection of the dead.\nAnd as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive\u201d (1 Cor.\n15: 54-55; 21-22).\nThe first of that numberless host of Christian martyrs who would be put to death by constituted authority for testifying to the truth, Christ commanded His disciples to \u201cFollow me!\u201d Inviting all to Calvary to \u201csuffer under Pontius Pilate\u201d with Him, He granted a meritorious share in accomplishing \u201cthe mystery which hath been hidden for ages and generations, but is now made manifest to his saints\u201d to all who, like St. Paul, would \u201cnow rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up those things which are wanting of the sufferings of Christ in my flesh, for his body which is the church.\n.\n.\u201d (Col. 1:26, 24).\nCriminals put to death undergo a penalty no different from the one exacted from the most innocent amongst us.\nAs with everyone else the moment of death ushers them either into heaven, hell or purgatory.\nThe most that can be said is that their lives here on earth are shortened, and they must settle their accounts sooner than expected.\nThis could be a great mercy for them as well as for society, both in terms of expiation and protection from any future crimes they might have perpetrated.\nThe death penalty, from the first one imposed on man by God in the beginning in Eden, to the one imposed on God by man on that Good Friday in Jerusalem, on down to those still being imposed today, transcends human legislation.\nBy divine decree it will perdure until the end of time, when \u201cthe former things are passed away.\u201d Only then \u201cdeath shall be no more, nor mourning, nor crying, nor sorrow shall be any more,\u201d and not one minute sooner.\n(Apo.\n21:4).\n", ["Repetition", "Thought-terminating_Cliches", "Doubt", "Appeal_to_fear-prejudice", "Black-and-White_Fallacy",

hospital.\nBut it has been made clear to him that if he attempts to go to a hospital he will not be given free passage and he will be arrested.\nSince he was arrested in 2010, Assange has not been charged with a single crime.\nHis treatment amounts to the most unprecedented persecution.\nJulian could leave the embassy if his own government, the government of his homeland, Australia, applied legitimate diplomatic pressure on behalf of its citizen.\nWe must ask ourselves why this hasn\u2019t happened.\nMy own feeling is that there is a great deal of collusion between the Australian, the British and the US governments\u2013meant to close down WikiLeaks completely and/or deliver Julian Assange to the Americans.\nRecently the Australian foreign minister, Julie Bishop, traveled with senior officials to London and to Washington and raised the whole matter of Julian.\nBut they raised it in a way that didn\u2019t support the idea that a government should represent its citizens.\nThese people listened to the more powerful governments.\nIn Washington they met Mr. Pompeo, who refused to discuss Assange altogether.\nI think there is collusion which amounts to an attempt to try to do a deal with Assange whereby he might be allowed free passage of return to Australia if he shuts down WikiLeaks.\nI think that is very, very likely.\nAs I understand Julian, this

WikiLeaks is that it is outside of the establishment and is truly independent.\nDB: What would be your strongest plea for Julian Assange?\nJP: It\u2019s very simple.\nThis is about justice.\nIn a famous speech given in the 1930\u2019s by Parson Martin Niemoller, he said that first the Nazis came for socialists, but he didn\u2019t speak up because that didn\u2019t concern him.\nThen they came for trade unionists, but he didn\u2019t speak up because that didn\u2019t concern him.\nHe didn\u2019t speak up when they came for the Jews because he wasn\u2019t a Jew.\nAnd, of course, finally they came for him.\nThat might not be a precise parallel, but if Julian Assange is allowed to literally go under, it represents the conquest of all of us.\nIt means that we have kept quiet.\nKeeping quiet has allowed the great atrocities of histories to take place.\nIf Julian is allowed to be spirited away to some super-max hellhole, it will be a great atrocity.\nDB: In the library, silence is

of the strong and vibrant faith of this local Church.\nI\u2019ve been praying that prayer even more earnestly in these past weeks as the Church in the United States has once again come face-to-face with its sins, with reports that former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, one of the most prominent Churchmen in the United States in the last quarter century, has been accused of abusing two minors and sexually harassing or assaulting a number of seminarians and young priests.\nTo make matters worse (if that is even possible), evidence has surfaced that indicates that a bishop, as well as some priests and laity, had brought the allegations about misconduct with seminarians to the attention of Church authorities but to no avail: Archbishop McCarrick was nonetheless \u201cpromoted\u201d to become the archbishop in our nation\u2019s capital, and elevated to the College of Cardinals.\nWhile I realize that it is not always easy to evaluate the credibility of those bringing allegations, and that there\u2019s often a tendency to believe those we know over those we don\u2019t, I don\u2019t think that the Church in the United States will rest \u2014 and confidence will be restored \u2014 until the matter is independently investigated and explained, and assurances are given that there are safeguards in place to make sure that something like this couldn\u2019t happen again.\nThe matter has been particularly troubling to me personally due to the fact that I had served in the Archdiocese of Newark as coadjutor archbishop from November 4, 2013, to March 25, 2016, when I was named archbishop here.\nIt was while I was in Newark that I was introduced to then-Cardinal McCarrick.\nA number of good Catholics have written to ask for a personal accounting on my part, inquiring whether I was made aware in my time in Newark of the 2005 and 2007 settlements involving Archbishop McCarrick, or if I knew of any allegations against him.\nI can state unequivocally that I learned of those settlements only in June of this year, as news broke about the unrelated claim that had been filed in the Archdiocese of New York.\nWhat I know of the settlements I know from the newspapers.\nWhen serving in Newark, I was regularly briefed on current legal matters of all sorts, but not on past legal matters (unless they were still being discussed in the press).\nBy the time I arrived in Newark in November 2013, the 2005 and 2007 settlements were apparently considered ancient history.\nIt would be untrue to state that I had never heard any allegations about Cardinal McCarrick.\nYears before I ever lived in Newark, and never imagining that I would be assigned there, I had indeed read \u2014 as a somewhat geeky ex-lawyer \u2014 an allegation about Cardinal McCarrick in the context of a 2005 lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against Archbishop Myers, Cardinal Eagan, Bishop Hubbard and the Irish Christian Brothers.\nWhile the complaint didn\u2019t supply any details, the plaintiff was reported to have said to a journalist that \u201cArchbishop McCarrick would share a bed with seminarians but not engage in any activity with them.\u201d The complaint would later be formally amended to include that allegation.\nKnowing, however, that this lawsuit was completely dismissed by the state and federal courts, I never gave the particular allegation about Cardinal McCarrick any credence.\nI can also state without exception that no one in my years in Newark ever told me that they were improperly touched by Archbishop McCarrick, and no one ever told me that they had to share a bed with him or that they had seen anyone share a bed with him.\nI heard lots of gut-wrenching stories in my two-and-a-half years there, but none of them involved Archbishop McCarrick.\nWith St. John Paul II\u2019s 1995 visit, he was remembered for \u201cbringing a saint to Newark,\u201d not as an abuser of seminarians, minors or priests.\nWhen I was installed here in St. Paul, he joined me at lunch along with my father, sister, godmother and then 12-year-old nephew.\nI can assure you that I would never have allowed that to happen if I had any reason to know or even suspect the things that have been reported in the newspapers this past month.\nWhile the letters and emails of recent days are sober reminders that there\u2019s still a long way to go in restoring trust, I nonetheless welcome the efforts to hold me accountable to you, the faithful of this archdiocese.\nThe events of these past weeks have shown that no one can be above the law, regardless of rank or privilege.\nI was grateful for the opportunity to reinforce that with our seminarians this past weekend, and I look forward to continuing my work with the Office of Ministerial Standards and Safe Environment, and our Archdiocesan Review Board, in creating a culture in which no one need be afraid or reluctant to bring forth an allegation of misconduct.\nOur heavenly patron, St. Paul, reminds us that \u201cwhere sin abounds, grace abounds all the more.\u201d May these difficult days be days of great grace for this local Church.\nREMNANT COMMENT: While we certainly appreciate His Excellency's candid explanation of what he knew and did not know about this horrific scandal in the Church, we would also humbly beg him to take it one step further by publicly proclaiming his profession of belief in the Church's official teaching against the mortal sin of homosexual acts and the so-called \"gay lifestyle,\" which includes her long-held teaching that homosexual activity between clerics is an ecclesiastical crime.\nFar from being reassured of this by their bishops, many Catholic faithful today are informed that the modern Catholic Church is now an \"inclusive community\" that \"welcomes all\" and \"judges none.\"\nAll very well and good, except for the fact that the Church's constant and unchanging moral teaching on this makes no such allowance.\nIn fact, this binding and constant teaching of the Church was reaffirmed most recently in her most authoritative modern catechism, which holds the exact opposite position from that apparently held by many bishops:\nHomosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex... Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity, tradition has always declared that \"homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.\"\nThey are contrary to the natural law.\nThey close the sexual act to the gift of life.\nThey do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity.\nUnder no circumstances can they be approved.\n(Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2357)\nUnder no circumstances\u2026except for those dreamed up by a number of bishops in this country who apparently think that it should be left up to individual parishes to decide if they are LGBTQ-friendly or not.\nEven Pope John Paul \"The GREAT's\" Vatican clarified the Church's teaching on October 31, 1986, in the \u201cLetter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons\u201d:\nAlthough the particular inclination of the homosexual person is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil; thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder.\nTherefore special concern and pastoral attention should be directed to those who have this condition, lest they be led to believe that the living out of this orientation in homosexual activity is a morally acceptable option.\nIt is not.\nNotice the late pope does not say, \u201cLet the practicing homosexuals have a spiritual home among your faithful,\u201d as Father James Martin and his episcopal fans are at least implying on a regular basis in the media.\nDoes Archbishop Hebda believe it is time for the Church to stop humiliating herself by stooping to accommodate a special interest group that obviously doesn't care about her or the moral code by which she governs?\nDoes he believe that all Catholics must follow the rules of the Church pertaining to the Sixth Commandment...or just the straight Catholics?\nDoes His Excellency believe that if some homosexual Catholics feel they need not bother following the rules they should be warmly welcomed into our \"Catholic Christian\" community anyway, even if they are in same-sex unions?\nPope John Paul certainly didn't accept that.\nIn his 2005 book Memory and Identity, John Paul referred to homosexuality as an \u201cideology of evil,\u201d insisting of so-called 'gay marriage' that:\n\u201cIt is legitimate and necessary to ask oneself if this is not perhaps part of a new ideology of evil, perhaps more insidious and hidden, which attempts to pit human rights against the family and man.\u201d\nWas Pope John Paul THE GREAT an intolerant homophobe?\nAre Father Martin and his pals in the episcopacy really so enlightened over every pope, saint, and moral theologian in history?\nOr is it not so that it is both negligent and uncharitable for some bishops to refuse to inform their faithful that according to the Church's own infallible teaching, everlasting damnation is the price to be paid for this kind of inclusivity and toleration?\nAnd if the episcopal retort is going to be that this acceptance refers only to chaste homosexuals, then we call FOUL even louder since this crosses the line into willful deception.\nWe're all sinners, of course--- and the Church already accepts repentant homosexuals as they are, just as she accepts repentant practitioners of ANY sins of the flesh.\nSo why are our bishops playing dumb?\nQuite obviously, it is because what they are actually closing an episcopal eye to are the folks who want to keep right on sinning--and sinning proudly.\nThis is what the Church of Accompaniment is all about!\nBut, practically speaking--in the real world--this kind of \"accompaniment\" is only green-lighting vice and mortal sin, and as such constitutes a hideous violation of everything these bishops supposedly believe as Catholic priests.\nSo what's going on here?\nWho are these bishops that think they can play fast and loose not only with the moral theology of the Catholic Church, but also with the immortal souls of their flock?\nIs it any wonder that priests and laity alike are changing their attitude on the \"gay lifestyle\" and violations of the Sixth Commandment when so many bishops are working to remove the stigma attached to this sin that Scripture tells us cries to heaven for vengeance?\nThe Catholic Church's new-found \"climate of tolerance\" is exactly what McCarrick and company are counting on!\nIt is truly homophobic for any bishop to lie to the gay community about this, and to risk the immortal souls of the sheep merely so that the shepherd might pride himself on occupying the politically correct high ground.\nThis is gross dereliction of duty, and we hope and pray that all the good U.S. bishops would jump at the opportunity to issue statements reaffirming the Church's clear teaching against all sins of the flesh, homo- and heterosexual.\nAgain, God bless Archbishop Hebda for this welcome statement, and may God grant him the courage now to finish the task by publicly reassuring the scandalized faithful that it\u2019s not just abuse of minors or sexual harassment that\u2019s going on here.\nOur bishops must make it absolutely clear that the Church's moral theology on homosexuality will not and can not be trumped by the dictates of political correctness.\nAnd neither can God's law be changed to accommodate the spirit of our \u201cmost enlightened\u201d age---which is, of course, an evil spirit that can be driven out only by prayer and fasting.\nUntil the Church and her bishops get back to reaffirming traditional Catholic teaching on human sexuality we can forget about seeing an end to the sexual abuse crisis and the massive problem of homosexuality in the clergy.\nMcCarrick will become the norm, not the exception, and confidence in the leadership and moral authority of the Catholic Church will remain in the toilet indefinitely... exactly as the forces of darkness intended all along.\n",

["Hundreds of Priests Accused in Pennsylvania, Church of Accompaniment in Crisis\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Tuesday released a sweeping grand jury report on sex abuse in the Catholic Church, listing hundreds of accused clergy and detailing 70 years of misconduct and church response across the state.\nThe release is the culmination of an 18-month probe, led by state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, on six of the state\u2019s eight dioceses \u2014 Harrisburg, Pittsburgh, Allentown, Scranton, Erie and Greensburg \u2014 and follows other state grand jury reports that revealed abuse and coverups in two other dioceses.\nSome details and names that might reveal the 300 clergy listed have been redacted from the report.\nLegal challenges by clergy delayed the report\u2019s release, after some said it is a violation of their constitutional rights.\nPennsylvania\u2019s Supreme Court ruled last month that the report must be released but with some redaction.\nThe report\u2019s release begins an information war, with prosecutors and many victims saying it\u2019s the start of holding church leaders at the top accountable for the first time, while church lawyers and other advocates for the institution say the report depicts an era of another century, unfairly smearing today\u2019s Catholicism in Pennsylvania.\nThe report has helped renew a crisis many in the church thought and hoped had ended nearly 20 years ago after the scandal erupted in Boston.\nBut recent abuse-related scandals, from Chile to Australia, have reopened wounding questions about accountability and whether church officials are still covering up crimes at the highest levels.\nThe new wave of allegations has called Pope Francis\u2019s handling of abuse into question as many Catholics look to him to help the church regain its credibility.\nThe pope\u2019s track record has been mixed, something some outsiders attribute to his learning curve or shortcomings and others chalk up to resistance from a notoriously change-averse institution.\nThe Pennsylvania grand jury report follows the resignation last month of Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, a towering figure in the U.S. church and former D.C. archbishop who was accused of sexually abusing minors and adults for decades.\nBoth have further polarized the church on homosexuality, celibacy and whether laypeople should have more power.\nIt has also triggered debate about whether statutes of limitations should be expanded.\n\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a long-term struggle not only about the meaning of justice, but about the meaning of memory,\u201d said Jason Berry, a reporter and author who has covered the sexual abuse crisis for decades.\n\u201cAnd how honest the church has been about this crisis.\nMost bishops, besides apologies, have not been on the cutting edge of change.\u201d\nChurch officials began bracing for the aftermath of the report.\nOn Monday, D.C.\u2019s archbishop, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, former longtime leader of the Pittsburgh diocese, warned his priests in a letter that the probe will be \u201cprofoundly disturbing.\u201d\nREMNANT COMMENT: The report also shows that \u201cmore than 90 \u2018offenders\u2019 will be listed\u201d in Donald Cardinal Wuerl\u2019s former diocese, which is ironic since Wuerl is one of Pope Francis\u2019s closest U.S. advisers and sits on the Vatican\u2019s bishop oversight committee.\nWell played, Cardinal Wuerl!\nSo, let me get this straight (I know, lots of luck with that one): These are the people that are going to \"accompany us\" and our children in the \"synodal Church\" with its new orientation, overseen by a \"God of Surprises\" who is uber-merciful and doesn't judge, and headed up by a pope who, according to Father Thomas Rosica, \"breaks Catholic traditions whenever he wants, because he is 'free from disordered attachments'?''\nYou don't say!\nAll this and rampant homosexuality in the priesthood, too... along with a \"trivialized liturgy\" (according to Pope Benedict XVI) and widespread apostasy among the faithful?\nRemind me again: What exactly has Vatican II and the last fifty years of aggiornamento given us?\nBecause I can't seem to think of a darn thing, apart from heretical homilies, sodomitical clergy and an increasingly lavender liturgy.\nYou know what, guys?\nThanks, but no thanks.\nYou can take your 'Church of Accompaniment\" to prison with you.\nI'd sooner let my kids be accompanied by fans of the Oakland Raiders than turn them over to you... meaning no disrespect to fans of the Oakland Raiders, of course.\n#stopthesynod\n", ["Doubt", "Exaggeration,Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling,Labeling", "Appeal_to_Authority"]], ["Bishop Morlino Targets \u2018Homosexual Subculture\u2019 in the Church, Calls for Reparation to Sacred Heart of Jesus\nEditor\u2019s Note: Over the years, Bishop Robert Morlino of the Diocese of Madison has confirmed several of my children according to the traditional Rite of Confirmation, as his diocese has been a port in the storm for many displaced and disillusioned Catholic families.\nWe don\u2019t see eye-to-eye on everything, of course, but his faith and pastoral solicitude have for us been a light in the darkness and proof that God has not left us orphans.\nAnd now this, finally, a bishop with the courage to look the beast in the eye and speak its name out loud.\nBishop Morlino does this in a moment when he is under heavy attack as a \u201chater\u201d for defending the Church\u2019s teaching on marriage\u2014an attack, by the way, which prompted us here at The Remnant to join the fight to DEFEND BISHOP MORLINO last year.\n\"If you'll permit me, what the Church needs now is more hatred!\nAs I have said previously, St. Thomas Aquinas said that hatred of wickedness actually belongs to the virtue of charity.\nAs the Book of Proverbs says 'My mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate wickedness (Prov.\n8:7).'\nIt is an act of love to hate sin and to call others to turn away from sin.\n\u2013 Bishop Robert Morlino\nThis is what a courageous shepherd looks like!\nIn our opinion, during the most vile clergy sex scandal in history, every bishop in the country must do exactly what Bishop Morlino has done, i.e., issue a statement of fidelity to the Church\u2019s moral theology, specifically her teaching against the mortal sin of homosexual acts.\nIn so doing, the bishops will incur the wrath of the enemies of the Church, yes.\nThey will be crucified in the media, yes.\nBut they will also be doing their sacred duty before God in reassuring their thoroughly scandalized flocks that they are absolutely committed to the defense and enforcement of the Church\u2019s moral teaching at a time when it is under scurrilous attack from within.\nNothing less will do.\nBishop Morlino has now done it, and we respectfully demand that the rest of the American bishops either follow suit or face the charge of being complicit with the degenerate and even criminal shepherds, accounts of whose betrayal and vice now dominate the news.\nMay God bless and keep Bishop Robert Morlino.\nMJM\nBishop Robert C. Morlino's letter to the faithful on the ongoing sexual abuse crisis in the Church\nAugust 18, 2018\nDear brothers and sisters in Christ of the Diocese of Madison,\nThe past weeks have brought a great deal of scandal, justified anger, and a call for answers and action by many faithful Catholics here in the U.S. and overseas, directed at the Church hierarchy regarding sexual sins by bishops, priests, and even cardinals.\nStill more anger is rightly directed at those who have been complicit in keeping some of these serious sins from coming to light.\nFor my part \u2014 and I know I am not alone \u2014 I am tired of this.\nI am tired of people being hurt, gravely hurt!\nI am tired of the obfuscation of truth.\nI am tired of sin.\nAnd, as one who has tried \u2014 despite my many imperfections \u2014 to lay down my life for Christ and His Church, I am tired of the regular violation of sacred duties by those entrusted with immense responsibility from the Lord for the care of His people.\nThe stories being brought into light and displayed in gruesome detail with regard to some priests, religious, and now even those in places of highest leadership, are sickening.\nHearing even one of these stories is, quite literally, enough to make someone sick.\nBut my own sickness at the stories is quickly put into perspective when I recall the fact that many individuals have lived through them for years.\nFor them, these are not stories, they are indeed realities.\nTo them I turn and say, again, I am sorry for what you have suffered and what you continue to suffer in your mind and in your heart.\nIf you have not already done so, I beg you to reach out, as hard as that may be, and seek help to begin to heal.\nAlso, if you\u2019ve been hurt by a priest of our diocese, I encourage you to come forward, to make a report to law enforcement and to our Victim\u2019s Assistance Coordinator, so that we might begin, with you as an individual, to try and set things right to the greatest extent possible.\nThere is nothing about these stories that is okay.\nThese actions, committed by more than a few, can only be classified as evil, evil that cries out for justice and sin that must be cast out from our Church.\nFaced with stories of the depravity of sinners within the Church, I have been tempted to despair.\nAnd why?\nThe reality of sin \u2014 even sin in the Church \u2014 is nothing new.\nWe are a Church made of sinners, but we are sinners called to sanctity.\nSo what is new?\nWhat is new is the seeming acceptance of sin by some in the Church, and the apparent efforts to cover over sin by them and others.\nUnless and until we take seriously our call to sanctity, we, as an institution and as individuals, will continue to suffer the \u201cwages of sin.\u201d\nFor too long we have diminished the reality of sin \u2014 we have refused to call a sin a sin \u2014 and we have excused sin in the name of a mistaken notion of mercy.\nIn our efforts to be open to the world we have become all too willing to abandon the Way, the Truth, and the Life.\nIn order to avoid causing offense we offer to ourselves and to others niceties and human consolation.\nWhy do we do this?\nIs it out of an earnest desire to display a misguided sense of being \u201cpastoral?\u201d Have we covered over the truth out of fear?\nAre we afraid of being disliked by people in this world?\nOr are we afraid of being called hypocrites because we are not striving tirelessly for holiness in our own lives?\nPerhaps these are the reasons, but perhaps it is more or less complex than this.\nIn the end, the excuses do not matter.\nWe must be done with sin.\nIt must be rooted out and again considered unacceptable.\nLove sinners?\nYes.\nAccept true repentance?\nYes.\nBut do not say sin is okay.\nAnd do not pretend that grave violations of office and of trust come without grave, lasting consequences.\nFor the Church, the crisis we face is not limited to the McCarrick affair, or the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report, or anything else that may come.\nThe deeper crisis that must be addressed is the license for sin to have a home in individuals at every level of the Church.\nThere is a certain comfort level with sin that has come to pervade our teaching, our preaching, our decision making, and our very way of living.\nIf you\u2019ll permit me, what the Church needs now is more hatred!\nAs I have said previously, St. Thomas Aquinas said that hatred of wickedness actually belongs to the virtue of charity.\nAs the Book of Proverbs says \u201cMy mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate wickedness (Prov.\n8:7).\u201d It is an act of love to hate sin and to call others to turn away from sin.\nThere must be no room left, no refuge for sin \u2014 either within our own lives, or within the lives of our communities.\nTo be a refuge for sinners (which we should be), the Church must be a place where sinners can turn to be reconciled.\nIn this I speak of all sin.\nBut to be clear, in the specific situations at hand, we are talking about deviant sexual \u2014 almost exclusively homosexual \u2014 acts by clerics.\nWe\u2019re also talking about homosexual propositions and abuses against seminarians and young priests by powerful priests, bishops, and cardinals.\nWe are talking about acts and actions which are not only in violation of the sacred promises made by some, in short, sacrilege, but also are in violation of the natural moral law for all.\nTo call it anything else would be deceitful and would only ignore the problem further.\nThere has been a great deal of effort to keep separate acts which fall under the category of now-culturally-acceptable acts of homosexuality from the publically-deplorable acts of pedophilia.\nThat is to say, until recently the problems of the Church have been painted purely as problems of pedophilia \u2014 this despite clear evidence to the contrary.\nIt is time to be honest that the problems are both and they are more.\nTo fall into the trap of parsing problems according to what society might find acceptable or unacceptable is ignoring the fact that the Church has never held ANY of it to be acceptable \u2014 neither the abuse of children, nor any use of one\u2019s sexuality outside of the marital relationship, nor the sin of sodomy, nor the entering of clerics into intimate sexual relationships at all, nor the abuse and coercion by those with authority.\nIn this last regard, special mention should be made of the most notorious and highest in ranking case, that being the allegations of former-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick\u2019s (oft-rumored, now very public) sexual sins, predation, and abuse of power.\nThe well-documented details of this case are disgraceful and seriously scandalous, as is any covering up of such appalling actions by other Church leaders who knew about it based on solid evidence.\nWhile recent credible accusations of child sexual abuse by Archbishop McCarrick have brought a whole slew of issues to light, long-ignored was the issue of abuse of his power for the sake of homosexual gratification.\nIt is time to admit that there is a homosexual subculture within the hierarchy of the Catholic Church that is wreaking great devastation in the vineyard of the Lord.\nThe Church\u2019s teaching is clear that the homosexual inclination is not in itself sinful, but it is intrinsically disordered in a way that renders any man stably afflicted by it unfit to be a priest.\nAnd the decision to act upon this disordered inclination is a sin so grave that it cries out to heaven for vengeance, especially when it involves preying upon the young or the vulnerable.\nSuch wickedness should be hated with a perfect hatred.\nChristian charity itself demands that we should hate wickedness just as we love goodness.\nBut while hating the sin, we must never hate the sinner, who is called to conversion, penance, and renewed communion with Christ and His Church, through His inexhaustible mercy.\nAt the same time, however, the love and mercy which we are called to have even for the worst of sinners does not exclude holding them accountable for their actions through a punishment proportionate to the gravity of their offense.\nIn fact, a just punishment is an important work of love and mercy, because, while it serves primarily as retribution for the offense committed, it also offers the guilty party an opportunity to make expiation for his sin in this life (if he willingly accepts his punishment), thus sparing him worse punishment in the life to come.\nMotivated, therefore, by love and concern for souls, I stand with those calling for justice to be done upon the guilty.\nThe sins and crimes of McCarrick, and of far too many others in the Church, bring suspicion and mistrust upon many good and virtuous priests, bishops, and cardinals, and suspicion and mistrust upon many great and respectable seminaries and so many holy and faithful seminarians.\nThe result of the first instance of mistrust harms the Church and the very good work we do in Christ\u2019s name.\nIt causes others to sin in their thoughts, words, and deeds \u2014 which is the very definition of scandal.\nAnd the second mistrust harms the future of the Church, since our future priests are at stake.\nI said that I was tempted to despair in light of all of this.\nHowever, that temptation quickly passed, thanks be to God.\nNo matter how large the problem, we know that we are called to go forward in faith, to rely upon God\u2019s promises to us, and to work hard to make every bit of difference we can, within our spheres of influence.\nI have recently had the opportunity to talk directly with our seminarians about these very pressing matters, and I have begun to, and will continue to, talk with the priests of the diocese, as well as the faithful, in person and through my weekly column and homilies, making things as clear as I can, from my perspective.\nHere now, I offer a few thoughts to those of my diocese:\nIn the first place, we must continue to build upon the good work which we have accomplished in protecting the youth and vulnerable of our diocese.\nThis is a work on which we can never rest in our vigilance, nor our efforts to improve.\nWe must continue in our work of education for all and hold to the effective policies that have been implemented, requiring psychological exams for all candidates for ministry, as well as across-the-board background checks for anyone working with children or vulnerable individuals.\nHere again, I state, as we have done consistently, if you have knowledge of any sort of criminal abuse of children by someone in the Church, contact law enforcement.\nIf you need help in contacting law enforcement contact our Victim\u2019s Assistance Coordinator and she will help connect you with the best resources.\nIf you are an adult victim of sexual abuse from childhood, we still encourage you to reach out to law enforcement first, but even if you don\u2019t want to, please still reach out to us.\nTo our seminarians: If you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me and to the seminary rector.\nI will address it swiftly and vigorously.\nI will not stand for this in my diocese or anywhere I send men for formation.\nI trust that the seminaries I choose, very discriminately, to help form our men will not ignore this type of scandalous behavior, and I will continue to verify that expectation.\nTo our priests: Most simply, live out the promises you made on your ordination day.\nYou are called to serve Christ\u2019s people, beginning with praying daily the Liturgy of the Hours.\nThis is to keep you very close to God.\nIn addition, you promised to obey and be loyal to your bishop.\nIn obedience, strive to live out your priesthood as a holy priest, a hard working priest, and a pure and happy priest \u2014 as Christ Himself is calling you to do.\nAnd by extension, live a chaste and celibate life so that you can completely give your life to Christ, the Church, and the people whom he has called you to serve.\nGod will give you the graces to do so.\nAsk Him for the help you need daily and throughout every day.\nAnd if you are unchastely propositioned, abused, or threatened (no matter by whom), or if you directly witness unchaste behavior, report it to me.\nI will not stand for this in my diocese any more than in our seminaries.\nTo the faithful of the diocese: If you are the victim of abuse of any kind by a priest, bishop, cardinal, or any employee of the Church, bring it forward.\nIt will be addressed quickly and justly.\nIf you have directly witnessed sexual advances or any type of abuse, bring it forward as well.\nSuch actions are sinful and scandalous and we cannot allow anyone to use their position or power to abuse another person.\nAgain, in addition to injuring individuals, these actions injure the very Body of Christ, His Church.\nFurthermore, I add my name to those calling for real and sustained reform in the episcopate, priesthood, our parishes, schools, universities, and seminaries that would root out and hold accountable any would-be sexual predator or accomplice;\nI will hold the priests of the diocese to their promise to live a chaste and celibate life of service to you and your parish, and evidence of failure in this regard will be justly addressed;\nI will likewise hold every man studying for the priesthood for our diocese accountable to living a chaste and celibate life as part of his formation for the priesthood.\nFailure to do so will lead to dismissal from diocesan sponsorship;\nI will continue to require (with our men and our funds) that all seminaries to which we send men to study be vigilant that seminarians are protected from sexual predators and provide an atmosphere conducive to their holistic formation as holy priests, in the image of Christ;\nI ask all the faithful of the diocese to assist in keeping us accountable to civil authorities, the faithful in the pews, and to God Almighty, not only to protect children and the youth from sexual predators in the Church, but our seminarians, university students, and all the faithful as well.\nI promise to put any victim and their sufferings before that of the personal and professional reputation of a priest, or any Church employee, guilty of abuse;\nI ask everyone reading this to

ourselves accountable first and, in turn, hold our brothers and sisters accountable as well, and\nFinally, I ask you all to join me and the entire clergy of the Diocese of Madison in making public and private acts of reparation to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus and to the Immaculate Heart of Mary for all the sins of sexual depravity committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy.\nI will be offering a public Mass of reparation on Friday, September 14, the Feast of the Triumph of the Holy Cross, at Holy Name Heights and I ask all pastors to do the same in their own parishes.\nIn addition, I ask that all priests, clergy, religious, and diocesan employees join me in observing the upcoming Autumn Ember Days (Sep. 19, 21, and 22) as days of fasting and abstinence in reparation for the sins and outrages committed by members of the clergy and episcopacy and I invite all the faithful to do the same.\nSome sins, like some demons, can only be driven out by prayer and fasting.\nThis letter and these statements and promises are not intended to be an exhaustive list of what we can and need to do in the Church to begin to heal from, and stave off, this deep illness in the Church, but rather the next steps I believe we can take locally.\nMore than anything else, we as a Church must cease our acceptance of sin and evil.\nWe must cast out sin from our own lives and run toward holiness.\nWe must refuse to be silent in the face of sin and evil in our families and communities and we must demand from our pastors \u2014 myself included \u2014 that they themselves are striving day in and day out for holiness.\nWe must do this always with loving respect for individuals but with a clear understanding that true love can never exist without truth.\nAgain, right now there is a lot of justified anger and passion coming from many holy and faithful lay people and clerics across the country, calling for real reform and \u201chouse cleaning\u201d of this type of depravity.\nI stand with them.\nI don\u2019t know yet how this will play out nationally or internationally.\nBut I do know this, and I make this my last point and last promise, for the Diocese of Madison: \u201cAs

Cardinal Kevin Farrell, was the former roommate of the most prolific serial predator of youth and seminarians in the history of the American Church.\nHow inconvenient that Farrell, Head of this Synod on Youth, roomed with the notorious Cardinal Theodore McCarrick for six years and never knew anything about McCarrick\u2019s predatory behavior.\nHow inconvenient that a global homosexual clergy predation scandal is erupting at a time when Francis wants the Synod to minimize that nagging and unmerciful Catholic catechism doctrine of homosexuality as \u201cintrinsically disordered\u201d by exploiting the naive views of the youth at the Synod.\nHow inconvenient that homosexual predation is bankrupting the American Church and the Instrumentum Laboris, the working document of this Vatican

the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report, while the Instrumentum Laboris argues that:\n\u201cSome LGBT youths, through various contributions that were received by the General Secretariat of the Synod, wish to benefit from greater closeness and experience greater care by the Church, while some Bishop Conferences ask themselves what to suggest to young people who decide to create homosexual instead of heterosexual couples and, above all, would like to be close to the Church.\u201d \u00a7197 IL\nHow inconvenient that during a global prelate homosexual coverup scandal, the 2018 Synodal Bishop

impromptu airplane presser when he cleverly sent a powerful message to homosexual clerics, \u201cWho Am I to Judge,\u201d now Francis must judge the criminal predatory conduct of homosexual clergy and prelates who preyed on youth and seminarians.\nThe emerging homosexual clergy scandal is just beginning to unfold.\nThe laity will learn over the course of the next few years that the underlying cause of the criminal scandal lies in the homosexual network of priests, bishops and cardinals who preyed on the youth, assaulted seminarians, promoted their own ilk, and punished any whistleblowers or noncompliant priests.\nHere is the dirty secret that is now emerging.\nMany in the hierarchy were active homosexuals who intentionally relaxed and ignored the Church\u2019s teaching and moral stance on homosexuality.\nThe personal wreckage brutally portrayed in the Pennsylvania Grand Jury Report is the direct result of a clerical culture which embraced homosexuality and groomed, recruited, and assaulted young people into this sordid lifestyle.\nMany priests, bishops, and cardinals practiced what Francis preached, \u2018who am I to judge.\u2019\nThe result?\nA litany of lives of total moral, physical, emotional devastation suffered by victims of homosexual clerics.\nThis is just the very beginning of the dark night of the soul of the Catholic Church.\nThe upcoming Synod and its embrace of the \u201cLGBT\u201d lifestyle makes a mockery of the suffering of the clergy victims and justifies the decades-old scandal.\nBe forewarned that inviting young people from ages 16-29 to the Synod to discuss vocations with Bishops poses serious moral and physical dangers to these unsuspecting youth, many of whom think homosexuality is cool.\nAnd the Bishops know it.\nThe full extent of the clerical predation in the hierarchy will take years to uncover.\nUntil it has, this Synod must be cancelled while the civil authorities and law enforcement fully investigate the breadth and depth of the homosexual clerical predation.\nThe warning signs and rainbow flags are flamboyantly flashing that the 2018 Synod on the Youth and Vocations in Rome presents great moral and physical exploitation of the youth.\nAccording to the Vatican, the chosen topic of the 2018 Synod, is an \u201cexpression of the Church\u2019s pastoral concern for the young,\u201d and is in continuity with the findings of the two-fold synod on the family and Francis\u2019s post-synodal document Amoris Laetitia.\nWe\u2019ve caught on to his sneaky synodal tactics.\nFrancis cleverly uses the synodal process to relax church doctrine by employing secular tools of surveys and focus groups.\nAnd, if the necessary results aren\u2019t computed, they will skewer the results.\nMagisterium by majority vote or stuff the ballot box.\nThe only compelling \u201cexpression of the Church\u2019s pastoral concern for the young\u201d belongs in the full and transparent cooperation of criminal investigations into predatory homosexual predation.\nTurn over the documents secret archives involving predation, both in the Vatican and in the chanceries around the globe.\nThat is the only expression that will demonstrate concern for the young.\nSign the Petition to Stop the Synod Here.\nEditor's Note: The Remnant has lunched its own #StopTheSynod petition, for those who would rather not go to Change.org.\nOur petition

Mueller III\u2019s Russia investigation, saying cryptically Monday the special counsel is \u201clooking for trouble.\u201d\nTrump alleged in a morning tweet series that the former FBI director is \u201cDisgraced and discredited,\u201d claiming his staff amounts to nothing more than a \u201cgroup of Angry Democrat Thugs.\u201d\nThat came hours after a Sunday tweet in which he referred to the special counsel team as a \u201cgang.\u201d Both are words with loaded meanings for his conservative political base.\nThe president\u2019s Sunday and Monday attacks on Mueller and his team came after reports that White House Counsel Donald McGahn was interviewed by Mueller and his team for more than one full day.\nTrump contends he signed off on the testimony; George W. Bush-era White House counsel and attorney general Alberto Gonzales, however, told CNN Monday morning that a sitting White House counsel would be required to fully cooperate with a federal investigation because he is a government lawyer, not a president\u2019s personal attorney.\nBut Trump on Monday morning tweeted that McGahn spoke with the special counsel team for \u201cover 30 hours with the White House Councel, only with my approval, for purposes of transparency.\u201d (The tweet included a misspelling of \u201ccounsel.\u201d)\nThe length of the Mueller-McGahn sessions led Trump to the conclusion the special counsel is \u201clooking for trouble\u201d because they \u201cthey know there is no Russian Collusion.\u201d\nBut Mueller reportedly is keenly interested in a widely studied June 2016 Trump Tower meeting arranged by Donald Trump Jr., which included a Russian attorney who promised to hand over negative information about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\nThe session also was attended by then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner; the president dictated a misleading statement about it a year later and it remains murky just when he learned about the meeting.\nAs Roll Call has reported, Trump was in the tower at the time of the session with the Russian lawyer.\nThe president also continued to push a line first floated by his attorney, former New York mayor and U.S. attorney Rudolph Giuliani, tweeting that campaign collusion with Russia would be a \u201cphony crime.\u201d He\u2019s right, there is no specific collusion statute.\nBut legal experts say anyone in Trump\u2019s orbit would be charged with conspiracy, making false statements to federal investigators or obstructing justice.\nAll are federal crimes.\nTrump also continued to cast himself as a victim in the matter, saying when he attempts to \u201cFIGHT BACK or say anything bad about the Rigged Witch Hunt,\u201d his critics \u201cscream Obstruction!\u201d\nMueller also is looking at whether some of Trump\u2019s actions like firing then-FBI Director James B.

we abandoned them,\u201d Francis said.\n\u201cLooking back to the past, no effort to beg pardon and to seek to repair the harm done will ever be sufficient.\nLooking ahead to the future, no effort must be spared to create a culture able to prevent such situations from happening, but also to prevent the possibility of their being covered up and perpetuated,\u201d he added.\nColm O\u2019Gorman, an Irish abuse survivor who founded One in Four, the main survivors\u2019 group in Ireland, commented on Twitter that the pope offered \u201cMuch stronger language than ever used before.\u201d\nBut O\u2019Gorman added: \u201c(The pope) begs for forgiveness, but still does not admit or own the deliberate policy of cover up designed & implemented by the #Vatican.\u201d\nLike his predecessor, Francis has promised \u201czero tolerance\u201d on child abuse, but scandals have kept recurring in several parts of the world \u2014 including in Australia recently.\nIn January, the pope was accused of insensitivity and tone-deafness after insisting, during a visit to Chile, that local abuse survivors had no \u201cproof\u201d against a bishop who allegedly witnessed abuse and failed to report it.\nFollowing an outcry, Francis apologized for his remarks, held private meetings with victims at the Vatican, and, after envoys he sent to Chile backed up victims\u2019 claims, the entire leadership of the Chilean Catholic church tendered their resignations.\nAccording to church expert John L Allen, an editor at specialized website Crux.com, the Catholic Church has a structural problem when it comes to dealing with cover up accusations.\n\u201cSixteen years since the crisis first erupted in the U.S., almost ten years since that happened in Ireland, and now more than five years since Francis was elected, the Catholic Church still has no credible, transparent process for handling cases when the accusation against a bishop isn\u2019t the direct commission of abuse but rather covering up someone else\u2019s crimes,\u201d Allen said in a Sunday column.\n\u2014 Alvise Armellini\ndpa\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\u00a92018 Deutsche Presse-Agentur GmbH (Hamburg, Germany), Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n", ["Doubt", "Appeal_to_fear-prejudice", "Exaggeration,Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling,Labeling", "Appeal_to_Authority"]], ["Jeff Sessions lashes back at Trump\nPersonal Liberty Poll Exercise your right to vote.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Attorney General Jeff Sessions has a message for Donald Trump: You\u2019re wrong, Mr. President.\nSessions long has been one of Trump\u2019s favorite pinatas, often taking the brunt of the president\u2019s public scorn.\nTrump offered this assessment of his hand-picked attorney general recusing himself from the Justice Department\u2019s special counsel probe of Russian election meddling: \u201cWhat kind of man is this?\u201d\nTrump, in an interview that aired Thursday morning, also blasted Sessions because, he said, the former Alabama senator \u201cnever took control of the Justice Department.\u201d\nAbout seven hours later, the country\u2019s top law enforcement officer fired back.\nAnd, by doing so, took on Trump publicly in a way few Republicans in Washington have during his turbulent 19-month-old presidency.\n\u201cI took control of the Department of Justice the day I was sworn in, which is why we have had unprecedented success at effectuating the President\u2019s agenda \u2014 one that protects the safety and security and rights of the American people, reduces violent crime, enforces our immigration laws, promotes economic growth, and advances religious liberty,\u201d the AG said in a statement.\n\u201cWhile I am Attorney General, the actions of the Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.\nI demand the highest standards, and where they are not met, I take action,\u201d Sessions added.\n\u201cHowever, no nation has a more talented, more dedicated group of law enforcement investigators and prosecutors than the United States.\u201d\nThat last statement comes amid nearly constant complaints from Trump that Justice Department and FBI investigators are being unfair to the president and his allies.\nThat line of criticism has been picked up by, among others, Rep.

have spared them rather than the righteous people in Sodom and Gomorra doing what God had commanded.\nAnd of course, not a second thought on man's behalf is given concerning the victims in these two cities.\nHere is Abraham\u2019s account\u2026\n\u201cAnd the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.\nAnd the Lord said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do; Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?\nFor I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.\nAnd the Lord said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.\nAnd the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the Lord.\nAnd Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?\nPeradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?\nThat be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\nAnd the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.\nAnd Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes: Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five?\nAnd he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.\nAnd he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there.\nAnd he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.\nAnd he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there.\nAnd he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.\nAnd he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto theLord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there.\nAnd he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.\nAnd he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there.\nAnd he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.\nAnd the Lord went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.\"\n-Genesis 18:16-33\nGot questions.org explains very well\u2026\nGenesis chapter 19 records the two angels, disguised as human men, visiting Sodom and Gomorrah.\nLot met the angels in the city square and urged them to stay at his house.\nThe angels agreed.\nThe Bible then informs us, \"Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom \u2014 both young and old \u2014 surrounded the house.\nThey called to Lot, 'Where are the men who came to you tonight?\nBring them out to us so that we can have sex with them.\nGenesis 19:4-5 The angels then proceed to blind all the men of Sodom and Gomorrah and urge Lot and his family to flee from the cities to escape the wrath that God was about to deliver.\nLot and his family flee the city, and then \"the LORD rained down burning sulfur on Sodom and Gomorrah \u2014 from the LORD out of the heavens.\nThus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain, including all those living in the cities...\" (Genesis 19:2 4) .\nIn light of the passage, the most common response to the question, \"What was the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah?\"\nis that it was homosexuality.\nThat is how the term \u201dsodomy\u201d came to be used to refer to anal sex between two men, whether consensual or forced.\nClearly, homosexuality was part of the reason God destroyed the two cities.\nThe men of Sodom and Gomorrah wanted to perform homosexual gang rape on the two angels, who were disguised as men.\nAt the same time, it is not biblical to say that homosexuality was the exclusive reason why God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.\nThe cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were definitely not exclusive in terms of the sins in which they indulged.\nEzekiel 16:49-50 declares, \"Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.\nThey were haughty and did detestable things before me...\" The Hebrew word translated \"detestable\" refers to something that is morally disgusting and is the exact same word used in Leviticus 18:22 that refers to homosexuality as an \"abomination.\"\nSimilarly, Jude 7 declares, \"...Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion.\"\nSo, again, while homosexuality was not the only sin in which the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah indulged, it does appear to be the primary reason for the destruction of the cities.\nThose who attempt to explain away the biblical condemnations of homosexuality claim that the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah was inhospitality.\nThe men of Sodom and Gomorrah were certainly being inhospitable.\nThere is probably nothing more inhospitable than homosexual gang rape.\nBut to say God completely destroyed two cities and all their inhabitants for being inhospitable clearly misses the point.\nWhile Sodom and Gomorrah were guilty of many other horrendous sins, homosexuality was the reason God poured fiery sulfur on the cities, completely destroying them and all of their inhabitants.\nTo this day, the area where Sodom and Gomorrah were located remains a desolate wasteland.\nSodom and Gomorrah serve as a powerful example of how God feels about sin in general, and homosexuality specifically.\nThe point is that there were no righteous to be spared and the Lord did what man failed to do when they had the time to do it.\nQuestion: How do you show mercy to a people who observe lying vanities (Jonah 2:4) and refuse to return to the Lord (Jeremiah 6:16) on His terms?\n(Jeremiah 22:3) God must be true and judgment must commence.\nMen today, like those of Sodom and Gomorrah, are not valiant for the truth.\nThey are valiant to proceed from evil to evil (Jeremiah 5).\nThey care more about the pleasures of sin for a season, than they are grieved for the afflictions of Joseph (Amos 6:6; Hebrews 11:25).\nMen today care more of compromise (where two men both agree on what they both know is wrong) and diplomacy (seduction in another guise) in promoting anarchy through \u201cantinomianism\u201d than they do the Law of God against the sins unto judgment that enslave men (John 8:34).\nInstead of establishing judgment within the gate and hating the evil and loving the good (Amos 5:15) in hopes that the Lord may be gracious to their repentance (2 Corinthians 7:10), they reject the counsel of God against them by hating the good and loving the evil, and that to their own damnation.\nThey care more about the approbation and favor of men than they do that of the Living God and what His Word declares (Galatians 1:10),not knowing that which his highly favored among men is an abomination unto the Lord (Luke 16:15).\nThey wear the cross.\nYet, they have no testimony of the power of God unto salvation by the cross because they do not practice what Christ required: \u201cDeny yourselves and take up your cross and follow Me\u201d (Matthew 16:24; Romans 1:16; 2 Corinthians 5:15, 13:4-5; Galatians 2:21).\nProfessed Christians in America today talk much of love through inaction, and yet know nothing of it (1 John 3:18).\nThey read what to do, but do it not!\nIn fact, they declare and proclaim how much they love God, and yet if you were to have them read His moral law and look to their own lives, they would find how much they actually hate God through their actions (Matthew 15:8).\nThen again, these were the same types of people in Jerusalem crying out \"Crucify him!\nCrucify him!\nWe have no king but Caesar\" (John 19:15).\nAnd these are the same people today persecuting living Christians while praising the dead ones (Matthew 5:10).\nThey continuously preach of the heroism of Abraham, Moses, Joshua, David, Gideon, Samson and others from the pulpit and fail to understand what these men were doing when serving their generations (Psalm 71:18-19; Isaiah 51:4).\nToday, instead of doing the same, they simply hide under a false grace (Isaiah 30) and give themselves over to a man, the president, and declare end times.\nThey declare we're in the end times because they have failed to stand up and fight for their posterity in keeping the Lord's commandments and His judgments (Psalm 78:1-11).\nUngrateful reprobates, pretenders, counterfeits and hypocrites are what they are (Matthew 23:3).\nInstead of reaching out to the greatest demographic here in America, public high schools, they send missionaries to foreign lands to do there what they fail to do for their own here.\nInstead of fighting for their posterity and shutting down the illegalities of sodomy in all 50 states, they teach them to just do their best to understand that they cannot help themselves while God say\u2019s the opposite (Leviticus 20:18).\nInstead of fighting on their behalf against the federal government that is illegally indoctrinating them, they simply give their kids over to them to be dumbed down.\nAnd instead of protesting the murder of 58 million innocent babies (Proverbs 6:17), they merely pass it off as a

of good and evil.\nRight and wrong?\nMaybe.\nBut good and evil have a supernatural ring we usually reserve for dramatic and abominable crimes, like genocide.\nYet everything right is good, and everything wrong is evil.\nThe evils we encounter in our day-to-day lives might not be a spectacle, like jihadists beheading a journalist on live television.\nAll the same, evil is part of ordinary life.\nIt dwells deep in our hearts \u2013 each and every one of us.\nThe Prince of this World has made a grand display of his authority in the last few centuries.\nOur saving grace is that, while Westerners no longer believe in God, they still believe in the Devil.\nWe\u2019re at least clear-eyed enough to recognize true evil at work in the world, even if we can no longer see the great Good hidden behind the veil.\nThis is the point about the McCarrick scandal that even religious commentators tend to overlook.\nHow was he allowed to go on molesting young priests and seminarians when virtually the entire Church hierarchy knew what he was up to?\nAnd how was such a depraved individual ordained in the first place, let alone promoted to Cardinal-Archbishop of Washington?\nThe answer is, ultimately, demonic.\nAs Catholics, we ask St. Michael to \u201ccast into Hell Satan and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls.\u201d McCarrick and his fellow perverts in the clergy are responsible, not only for their sexual abuses, but also for chasing good men away from the priesthood.\nSpend enough time in Catholic World and you inevitably meet good men who quit the seminary because of some rampant (and often violent) depravity.\nWhat could suit the Devil more than to watch the Church burn her wheat as she gathers the chaff?\nThe gates of Hell will not prevail against the Church, as Our Lord promised.\nBut they won\u2019t stop trying, either.\nThey\u2019ve attacked from the front, sending the Roman pagans, French Revolutionaries, and British American secularists.\nThey flank us by sending heretics like Arius, Luther, and Hans Kung.\nToday, there\u2019s also a fifth column working to tear down the walls from within \u2013 not only pedophiles like John Geoghan, but also predators like Theodore McCarrick.\nWhere did those fifth columnists enter?\nWhy, there\u2019s only one possible explanation: the Second Vatican Council.\nAggiornamento sounds like a Lefebvrist slur.\nThe idea that an ecumenical council of the Catholic Church would openly seek to \u201cbring itself up to date\u201d is ridiculous.\nYet that was precisely the aim.\nAs St Pope John XXIII explained, \u201cIts principal task will be concerned with the conditions and modernization of the Church after 20 centuries of life.\u201d It was not supposed (as some have claimed) to simply update the liturgy from its last redesign in 1570.\nThe goal was to align the Church more with modern world: a world defined, to a considerable extent, by its rejection of the Catholic world that flourished before the Protestant Reformation and French Revolution.\nNow, I don\u2019t believe Pope John saw himself as endangering either orthodoxy or sacred, immutable tradition.\nI share Pope Paul IV\u2019s view.\nWhen he heard that the Council was being convened, then-Cardinal Montini is supposed to have sighed, \u201cThis holy old boy doesn\u2019t realise what a hornet\u2019s nest he\u2019s stirring up.\u201d\nNonetheless, he stirred it.\nThe spirit of aggiornamento quickly spread through the Church in the 1960s \u2013 and the seminaries especially.\nSeminarians called for a more \u201cparticipatory\u201d administration.\nThey became involved in socialist politics.\nThey formed trade unions to demand the right to marry.\nThey practiced sauvage intercommunion.\nOf course, they had their enablers in the hierarchy as well.\nPerhaps the worst was Archbishop Marty of Paris, a leader of the \u201cpriest-worker movement\u201d who defended Marxist and existentialist atheisms on the floor of the Council.\nDuring a homily at the Cathedral, he also praised the soixantehuitards: \u201cthe great outburst of the younger generation that suddenly wanted to take its place in life\u201d that occurred in his city in May of 1968.\n\u201cOne also felt that, in these events of May,\u201d Marty continued, \u201cthe seriousness of the working class, which wants not only to earn a living wage, but also to find its freedom, its independence.\u201d Theaggiornamentistas was never purged from the Church, and certainly not from the seminaries.\nAs the modern world continued to reject traditional Christian mores, so too does the Church seem increasingly \u201cout of step\u201d and in need of \u201cmodernizing\u201d.\nInevitably, this came to mean the acceptance of homosexuality.\nBishop Wilton D. Gregory, as president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, infamously spoke of \u201can ongoing struggle to make sure that the Catholic priesthood is not dominated by homosexual men.\u201d\nBut that predominance has very little to do with homosexuality per se.\nRather, the 1960s rejection of celibacy in the seminaries naturally provided more (shall we say) opportunities for gay men \u2013 given that there are, of course, no women in Catholic seminaries.\nThis began driving away heterosexuals, as well as homosexuals who upheld the Church\u2019s teachings on chastity and celibacy.\nNeedless to say, not all gay priests are violent predators like McCarrick.\nBut the toleration of sexually active priests gave McCarrick cover to \u201cseduce\u201d his victims.\nMany have also speculated that, because McCarrick\u2019s victims were overwhelmingly above the age of consent, the media didn\u2019t consider them newsworthy.\nIf he\u2019d fondled a 12-year old altar boy, that would have been one thing.\nPedophile priests sell papers.\nBut taking an 18-year-old seminarian to bed?\nRunning that story would simply be outing a closeted gay man: an act the liberal press would no doubt consider \u201chomophobic\u201d, as Ross Douthat pointed out.\nMeanwhile, those bishops who didn\u2019t approve of his actions knew the culture \u2013 both within the Church and without her \u2013 were against them.\nThe post-Vatican Church doesn\u2019t like to come off as a nag.\nShe\u2019s not going to cause a fuss by purging sexually active gay men from the clergy just because\u2026 what?\nIt\u2019s immoral?\nThat\u2019s not very aggiornamentistic!\nThe world and our worldly bishops were, unsurprisingly, of one mind.\nAnd even if they were disgusted by McCarrick, these prelates weren\u2019t willing to jeopardize their careers by standing for justice against vice.\nWe seem to be slouching back to the old traditionalist trope: All the Church\u2019s problems would be solved if we\u2019d just go back to the Latin Mass.\nSomething went critically wrong during Vatican II that extends well beyond the Mass.\nAnd we can\u2019t drag the Church out of her present crisis until we have the courage to brave accusations of \u201cLefebvrism\u201d and say so.\nThose who love our Holy Mother \u2013 those who want to protect her boys and men from all the McCarricks and their perverse appetites \u2013 mustn\u2019t be deceived into thinking this is a small or an isolated issue.\nIt isn\u2019t.\nThis is the crisis of an ancient and immortal institution trying desperately to seem young and fashionable; like all old men, it only manages to come across as lecherous and pathetic.\nIts obsession with \u201cmodernization\u201d leads it to only adopt the vices of modernity.\nInstead of serving as ambassadors from the City of God, far too many of our priests and prelates have become agents of the City of Man.\nI don\u2019t know what it will take to set things right.\nI don\u2019t know what it will take to exorcise the \u201cspirit of Vatican II\u201d \u2013 the spirit of aggiornamento \u2013 from the Church.\nBut we will.\nChrist promised.\n", ["Repetition",

Calls on Francis to Resign\nIn this tragic moment for the Church in various parts of the world \u2014 the United States, Chile, Honduras, Australia, etc.\n\u2014 bishops have a very grave responsibility.\nI am thinking in particular of the United States of America, where I was sent as Apostolic Nuncio by Pope Benedict XVI on October 19, 2011, the memorial feast of the First North American Martyrs.\nThe Bishops of the United States are called, and I with them, to follow the example of these first martyrs who brought the Gospel to the lands of America, to be credible witnesses of the immeasurable love of Christ, the Way, the Truth and the Life.\nAlso, as this is an unprecedented moment in papal history, perhaps the unprecedented step of recalling Benedict XVI to the Chair of St. Peter should also be considered sooner rather than later, before this crisis gets any more out-of-control than it already is.\nMay God save His Church MJM\nSo serious is the cover-up that for the good of the Church and protection of the faithful, Archbishop Vigano has called on Pope Francis to resign.\nBut before Francis resigns, we the Catholic faithful demand that he also remove from the College of Cardinals those who conspired even before the 2013 conclave to make Jorge Mario Bergoglio pope come hell or high water.\nHe and the St. Gallen Group know exactly who they are.\nArchbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2's 11-page statement, released to the National Catholic Register, accuses Pope Francis of covering for McCarrick, ignoring the sanctions that Pope Benedict had imposed on McCarrick, and also of making McCarrick a trusted counselor who became Francis's \"kingmaker\" when it came to American appointments and was highly instrumental in the Pope's decision to elevate far-Left bishops such as Blase Cupich of Chicago and Joseph Tobin of Newark to the College of Cardinals.\nRemnant Editor's Note: This could well mark the beginning of the end of the disastrous pontificate of Pope Francis.\nThe former apostolic nuncio to the United States has accused Francis of repealing sanctions imposed by Pope Benedict XVI on then-Cardinal McCarrick for sexual abuse.\nThis is a charge most serious, perhaps without precedent in modern times.\nBishops and priests, abusing their authority, have committed horrendous crimes to the detriment of their faithful, minors, innocent victims, and young men eager to offer their lives to the Church, or by their silence have not prevented that such crimes continue to be perpetrated.\nTo restore the beauty of holiness to the face of the Bride of Christ, which is terribly disfigured by so many abominable crimes, and if we truly want to free the Church from the fetid swamp into which she has fallen, we must have the courage to tear down the culture of secrecy and publicly confess the truths we have kept hidden.\nWe must tear down the conspiracy of silence with which bishops and priests have protected themselves at the expense of their faithful, a conspiracy of silence that in the eyes of the world risks making the Church look like a sect, a conspiracy of silence not so dissimilar from the one that prevails in the mafia.\n\u201cWhatever you have said in the dark ... shall be proclaimed from the housetops\u201d (Lk.\n12:3).\nI had always believed and hoped that the hierarchy of the Church could find within itself the spiritual resources and strength to tell the whole truth, to amend and to renew itself.\nThat is why, even though I had repeatedly been asked to do so, I always avoided making statements to the media, even when it would have been my right to do so, in order to defend myself against the calumnies published about me, even by high-ranking prelates of the Roman Curia.\nBut now that the corruption has reached the very top of the Church\u2019s hierarchy, my conscience dictates that I reveal those truths regarding the heart-breaking case of the Archbishop Emeritus of Washington, D.C., Theodore McCarrick, which I came to know in the course of the duties entrusted to me by St. John Paul II, as Delegate for Pontifical Representations, from 1998 to 2009, and by Pope Benedict XVI, as Apostolic Nuncio to the United States of America, from October 19, 2011 until end of May 2016.\nAs Delegate for Pontifical Representations in the Secretariat of State, my responsibilities were not limited to the Apostolic Nunciatures, but also included the staff of the Roman Curia (hires, promotions, informational processes on candidates to the episcopate, etc.)\nand the examination of delicate cases, including those regarding cardinals and bishops, that were entrusted to the Delegate by the Cardinal Secretary of State or by the Substitute of the Secretariat of State.\nTo dispel suspicions insinuated in several recent articles, I will immediately say that the Apostolic Nuncios in the United States, Gabriel Montalvo and Pietro Sambi, both prematurely deceased, did not fail to inform the Holy See immediately, as soon as they learned of Archbishop McCarrick\u2019s gravely immoral behavior with seminarians and priests.\nIndeed, according to what Nuncio Pietro Sambi wrote, Father Boniface Ramsey, O.P.\u2019s letter, dated November 22, 2000, was written at the request of the late Nuncio Montalvo.\nIn the letter, Father Ramsey, who had been a professor at the diocesan seminary in Newark from the end of the \u201980s until 1996, affirms that there was a recurring rumor in the seminary that the Archbishop \u201cshared his bed with seminarians,\u201d inviting five at a time to spend the weekend with him at his beach house.\nAnd he added that he knew a certain number of seminarians, some of whom were later ordained priests for the Archdiocese of Newark, who had been invited to this beach house and had shared a bed with the Archbishop.\nThe office that I held at the time was not informed of any measure taken by the Holy See after those charges were brought by Nuncio Montalvo at the end of 2000, when Cardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State.\nLikewise, Nuncio Sambi transmitted to the Cardinal Secretary of State, Tarcisio Bertone, an Indictment Memorandum against McCarrick by the priest Gregory Littleton of the diocese of Charlotte, who was reduced to the lay state for a violation of minors, together with two documents from the same Littleton, in which he recounted his tragic story of sexual abuse by the then-Archbishop of Newark and several other priests and seminarians.\nThe Nuncio added that Littleton had already forwarded his Memorandum to about twenty people, including civil and ecclesiastical judicial authorities, police and lawyers, in June 2006, and that it was therefore very likely that the news would soon be made public.\nHe therefore called for a prompt intervention by the Holy See.\nIn writing up a memo[1] on these documents that were entrusted to me, as Delegate for Pontifical Representations, on December 6, 2006, I wrote to my superiors, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone and the Substitute Leonardo Sandri, that the facts attributed to McCarrick by Littleton were of such gravity and vileness as to provoke bewilderment, a sense of disgust, deep sorrow and bitterness in the reader, and that they constituted the crimes of seducing, requesting depraved acts of seminarians and priests, repeatedly and simultaneously with several people, derision of a young seminarian who tried to resist the Archbishop\u2019s seductions in the presence of two other priests, absolution of the accomplices in these depraved acts, sacrilegious celebration of the Eucharist with the same priests after committing such acts.\nIn my memo, which I delivered on that same December 6, 2006 to my direct superior, the Substitute Leonardo Sandri, I proposed the following considerations and course of action to my superiors:\n- Given that it seemed a new scandal of particular gravity, as it regarded a cardinal, was going to be added to the many scandals for the Church in the United States,\n- and that, since this matter had to do with a cardinal, and according to can.\n1405 \u00a7 1, No.\n2\u02da, \u201cipsius Romani Pontificis dumtaxat ius est iudicandi\u201d;\n- I proposed that an exemplary measure be taken against the Cardinal that could have a medicinal function, to prevent future abuses against innocent victims and alleviate the very serious scandal for the faithful, who despite everything continued to love and believe in the Church.\nI added that it would be salutary if, for once, ecclesiastical authority would intervene before the civil authorities and, if possible, before the scandal had broken out in the press.\nThis could have restored some dignity to a Church so sorely tried and humiliated by so many abominable acts on the part of some pastors.\nIf this were done, the civil authority would no longer have to judge a cardinal, but a pastor with whom the Church had already taken appropriate measures to prevent the cardinal from abusing his authority and continuing to destroy innocent victims.\nMy memo of December 6, 2006 was kept by my superiors, and was never returned to me with any actual decision by the superiors on this matter.\nSubsequently, around April 21-23, 2008, the Statement for Pope Benedict XVI about the pattern of sexual abuse crisis in the United States, by Richard Sipe, was published on the internet, at richardsipe.com.\nOn April 24, it was passed on by the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Cardinal William Levada, to the Cardinal Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone.\nIt was delivered to me one month later, on May 24, 2008.\nThe following day, I delivered a new memo to the new Substitute, Fernando Filoni, which included my previous one of December 6, 2006.\nIn it, I summarized Richard Sipe\u2019s document, which ended with this respectful and heartfelt appeal to Pope Benedict XVI: \u201cI approach Your Holiness with due reverence, but with the same intensity that motivated Peter Damian to lay out before your predecessor, Pope Leo IX, a description of the condition of the clergy during his time.\nThe problems he spoke of are similar and as great now in the United States as they were then in Rome.\nIf Your Holiness requests, I will personally submit to you documentation of that about which I have spoken.\u201d\nI ended my memo by repeating to my superiors that I thought it was necessary to intervene as soon as possible by removing the cardinal\u2019s hat from Cardinal McCarrick and that he should be subjected to the sanctions established by the Code of Canon Law, which also provide for reduction to the lay state.\nThis second memo of mine was also never returned to the Personnel Office, and I was greatly dismayed at my superiors for the inconceivable absence of any measure against the Cardinal, and for the continuing lack of any communication with me since my first memo in December 2006.\nBut finally I learned with certainty, through Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, then-Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, that Richard Sipe\u2019s courageous and meritorious Statement had had the desired result.\nPope Benedict had imposed on Cardinal McCarrick sanctions similar to those now imposed on him by Pope Francis: the Cardinal was to leave the seminary where he was living, he was forbidden to celebrate [Mass] in public, to participate in public meetings, to give lectures, to travel, with the obligation of dedicating himself to a life of prayer and penance.\nI do not know when Pope Benedict took these measures against McCarrick, whether in 2009 or 2010, because in the meantime I had been transferred to the Governorate of Vatican City State, just as I do not know who was responsible for this incredible delay.\nI certainly do not believe it was Pope Benedict, who as Cardinal had repeatedly denounced the corruption present in the Church, and in the first months of his pontificate had already taken a firm stand against the admission into seminary of young men with deep homosexual tendencies.\nI believe it was due to the Pope\u2019s first collaborator at the time, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, who notoriously favored promoting homosexuals into positions of responsibility, and was accustomed to managing the information he thought appropriate to convey to the Pope.\nIn any case, what is certain is that Pope Benedict imposed the above canonical sanctions on McCarrick and that they were communicated to him by the Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, Pietro Sambi.\nMonsignor Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lantheaume, then first Counsellor of the Nunciature in Washington and Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires a.i.\nafter the unexpected death of Nuncio Sambi in Baltimore, told me when I arrived in Washington \u2014 and he is ready to testify to it\u2014 about a stormy conversation, lasting over an hour, that Nuncio Sambi had with Cardinal McCarrick whom he had summoned to the Nunciature.\nMonsignor Lantheaume told me that \u201cthe Nuncio\u2019s voice could be heard all the way out in the corridor.\u201d\nPope Benedict\u2019s same dispositions were then also communicated to me by the new Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, Cardinal Marc Ouellet, in November 2011, in a conversation before my departure for Washington, and were included among the instructions of the same Congregation to the new Nuncio.\nIn turn, I repeated them to Cardinal McCarrick at my first meeting with him at the Nunciature.\nThe Cardinal, muttering in a barely comprehensible way, admitted that he had perhaps made the mistake of sleeping in the same bed with some seminarians at his beach house, but he said this as if it had no importance.\nThe faithful insistently wonder how it was possible for him to be appointed to Washington, and as Cardinal, and they have every right to know who knew, and who covered up his grave misdeeds.\nIt is therefore my duty to reveal what I know about this, beginning with the Roman Curia.\nCardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State until September 2006: all information was communicated to him.\nIn November 2000, Nunzio Montalvo sent him his report, passing on to him the aforementioned letter from Father Boniface Ramsey in which he denounced the serious abuses committed by McCarrick.\nIt is known that Sodano tried to cover up the Father Maciel scandal to the end.\nHe even removed the Nuncio in Mexico City, Justo Mullor, who refused to be an accomplice in his scheme to cover Maciel, and in his place appointed Sandri, then-Nuncio to Venezuela, who was willing to collaborate in the cover-up.\nSodano even went so far as to issue a statement to the Vatican press office in which a falsehood was affirmed, that is, that Pope Benedict had decided that the Maciel case should be considered closed.\nBenedict reacted, despite Sodano\u2019s strenuous defense, and Maciel was found guilty and irrevocably condemned.\nWas McCarrick\u2019s appointment to Washington and as Cardinal the work of Sodano, when John Paul II was already very ill?\nWe are not given to know.\nHowever, it is legitimate to think so, but I do not think he was the only one responsible for this.\nMcCarrick frequently went to Rome and made friends everywhere, at all levels of the Curia.\nIf Sodano had protected Maciel, as seems certain, there is no reason why he wouldn\u2019t have done so for McCarrick, who according to many had the financial means to influence decisions.\nHis nomination to Washington was opposed by then-Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re.\nAt the Nunciature in Washington there is a note, written in his hand, in which Cardinal Re disassociates himself from the appointment and states that McCarrick was 14th on the list for Washington.\nNuncio Sambi\u2019s report, with all the attachments, was sent to Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, as Secretary of State.\nMy two above-mentioned memos of December 6, 2006 and May 25, 2008, were also presumably handed over to him by the Substitute.\nAs already mentioned, the Cardinal had no difficulty in insistently presenting for the episcopate candidates known to be active homosexuals \u2014 I cite only the well-known case of Vincenzo de Mauro, who was appointed Archbishop-Bishop of Vigevano and later removed because he was undermining his seminarians \u2014 and in filtering and manipulating the information he conveyed to Pope Benedict.\nCardinal Pietro Parolin, the current Secretary of State, was also complicit in covering up the misdeeds of McCarrick who had, after the election of Pope Francis, boasted openly of his travels and missions to various continents.\nIn April 2014, the Washington Times had a front page report on McCarrick\u2019s trip to the Central African Republic, and on behalf of the State Department no less.\nAs Nuncio to Washington, I wrote to Cardinal Parolin asking him if the sanctions imposed on McCarrick by Pope Benedict were still valid.\n\u00c7a va sans dire that my letter never received any reply!\nThe same can be said for Cardinal William Levada, former Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, for Cardinals Marc Ouellet, Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, Lorenzo Baldisseri, former Secretary of the same Congregation for Bishops, and Archbishop Ilson de Jesus Montanari, current Secretary of the same Congregation.\nThey were all aware by reason of their office of the sanctions imposed by Pope Benedict on McCarrick.\nCardinals Leonardo Sandri, Fernando Filoni and Angelo Becciu, as Substitutes of the Secretariat of State, knew in every detail the situation regarding Cardinal McCarrick.\nNor could Cardinals Giovanni Lajolo and Dominique Mamberti have failed to know.\nAs Secretaries for Relations with States, they participated several times a week in collegial meetings with the Secretary of State.\nAs far as the Roman Curia is concerned, for the moment I will stop here, even if the names of other prelates in the Vatican are well known, even some very close to Pope Francis, such as Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio and Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia, who belong to the homosexual current in favor of subverting Catholic doctrine on homosexuality, a current already denounced in 1986 by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, then-Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, in the Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons.\nCardinals Edwin Frederick O\u2019Brien and Renato Raffaele Martino also belong to the same current, albeit with a different ideology.\nOthers belonging to this current even reside at the Domus Sanctae Marthae.\nNow to the United States.\nObviously, the first to have been informed of the measures taken by Pope Benedict was McCarrick\u2019s successor in Washington See, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, whose situation is now completely compromised by the recent revelations regarding his behavior as Bishop of Pittsburgh.\nIt is absolutely unthinkable that Nunzio Sambi, who was an extremely responsible person, loyal, direct and explicit in his way of being (a true son of Romagna) did not speak to him about it.\nIn any case, I myself brought up the subject with Cardinal Wuerl on several occasions, and I certainly didn\u2019t need to go into detail because it was immediately clear to me that he was fully aware of it.\nI also remember in particular the fact that I had to draw his attention to it, because I realized that in an archdiocesan publication, on the back cover in color, there was an announcement inviting young men who thought they had a vocation to the priesthood to a meeting with Cardinal McCarrick.\nI immediately phoned Cardinal Wuerl, who expressed his surprise to me, telling me that he knew nothing about that announcement and that he would cancel it.\nIf, as he now continues to state, he knew nothing of the abuses committed by McCarrick and the measures taken by Pope Benedict, how can his answer be explained?\nHis recent statements that he knew nothing about it, even though at first he cunningly referred to compensation for the two victims, are absolutely laughable.\nThe Cardinal lies shamelessly and prevails upon his Chancellor, Monsignor Antonicelli, to lie as well.\nCardinal Wuerl also clearly lied on another occasion.\nFollowing a morally unacceptable event authorized by the academic authorities of Georgetown University, I brought it to the attention of its President, Dr. John DeGioia, sending him two subsequent letters.\nBefore forwarding them to the addressee, so as to handle things properly, I personally gave a copy of them to the Cardinal with an accompanying letter I had written.\nThe Cardinal told me that he knew nothing about it.\nHowever, he failed to acknowledge receipt of my two letters, contrary to what he customarily did.\nI subsequently learned that the event at Georgetown had taken place for seven years.\nBut the Cardinal knew nothing about it!\nCardinal Wuerl, well aware of the continuous abuses committed by Cardinal McCarrick and the sanctions imposed on him by Pope Benedict, transgressing the Pope\u2019s order, also allowed him to reside at a seminary in Washington D.C.\nIn doing so, he put other seminarians at risk.\nBishop Paul Bootkoski, emeritus of Metuchen, and Archbishop John Myers, emeritus of Newark, covered up the abuses committed by McCarrick in their respective dioceses and compensated two of his victims.\nThey cannot deny it and they must be interrogated in order to reveal every circumstance and all responsibility regarding this matter.\nCardinal Kevin Farrell, who was recently interviewed by the media, also said that he didn\u2019t have the slightest idea about the abuses committed by McCarrick.\nGiven his tenure in Washington, Dallas and now Rome, I think no one can honestly believe him.\nI don\u2019t know if he was ever asked if he knew about Maciel\u2019s crimes.\nIf he were to deny this, would anybody believe him given that he occupied positions of responsibility as a member of the Legionaries of Christ?\nRegarding Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, I would simply say that his latest statements on the McCarrick case are disconcerting, and have totally obscured his transparency and credibility.\n* * *\nMy conscience requires me also to reveal facts that I have experienced personally, concerning Pope Francis, that have a dramatic significance, which as Bishop, sharing the collegial responsibility of all the bishops for the universal Church, do not allow me to remain silent, and that I state here, ready to reaffirm them under oath by calling on God as my witness.\nIn the last months of his pontificate, Pope Benedict XVI had convened a meeting of all the apostolic nuncios in Rome, as Paul VI and St. John Paul II had done on several occasions.\nThe date set for the audience with the Pope was Friday, June 21, 2013.\nPope Francis kept this commitment made by his predecessor.\nOf course I also came to Rome from Washington.\nIt was my first meeting with the new Pope elected only three months prior, after the resignation of Pope Benedict.\nOn the morning of Thursday, June 20, 2013, I went to the Domus Sanctae Marthae, to join my colleagues who were staying there.\nAs soon as I entered the hall I met Cardinal McCarrick, who wore the red-trimmed cassock.\nI greeted him respectfully as I had always done.\nHe immediately said to me, in a tone somewhere between ambiguous and triumphant: \u201cThe Pope received me yesterday, tomorrow I am going to China.\u201d\nAt the time I knew nothing of his long friendship with Cardinal Bergoglio and of the important part he had played in his recent election, as McCarrick himself would later reveal in a lecture at Villanova University and in an interview with the National Catholic Reporter.\nNor had I ever thought of the fact that he had participated in the preliminary meetings of the recent conclave, and of the role he had been able to have as a cardinal elector in the 2005 conclave.\nTherefore I did not immediately grasp the meaning of the encrypted message that McCarrick had communicated to me, but that would become clear to me in the days immediately following.\nThe next day the audience with Pope Francis took place.\nAfter his address, which was partly read and partly delivered off the cuff, the Pope wished to greet all the nuncios one by one.\nIn single file, I remember that I was among the last.\nWhen it was my turn, I just had time to say to him, \u201cI am the Nuncio to the United States.\u201d He immediately assailed me with a tone of reproach, using these words: \u201cThe Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized!\nThey must be shepherds!\u201dOf course I was not in a position to ask for explanations about the meaning of his words and the aggressive way in which he had upbraided me.\nI had in my hand a book in Portuguese that Cardinal O\u2019Malley had sent me for the Pope a few days earlier, telling me \u201cso he could go over his Portuguese before going to Rio for World Youth Day.\u201d I handed it to him immediately, and so freed myself from that extremely disconcerting and embarrassing situation.\nAt the end of the audience the Pope announced: \u201cThose of you who are still in Rome next Sunday are invited to concelebrate with me at the Domus Sanctae Marthae.\u201d I naturally thought of staying on to clarify as soon as possible what the Pope intended to tell me.\nOn Sunday June 23, before the concelebration with the Pope, I asked Monsignor Ricca, who as the person in charge of the house helped us put on the vestments, if he could ask the Pope if he could receive me sometime in the following week.\nHow could I have returned to Washington without having clarified what the Pope wanted of me?\nAt the end of Mass, while the Pope was greeting the few lay people present, Monsignor Fabian Pedacchio, his Argentine secretary, came to me and said: \u201cThe Pope told me to ask if you are free now!\u201d Naturally, I replied that I was at the Pope\u2019s disposal and that I thanked him for receiving me immediately.\nThe Pope took me to the first floor in his apartment and said: \u201cWe have 40 minutes before the Angelus.\u201d\nI began the conversation, asking the Pope what he intended to say to me with the words he had addressed to me when I greeted him the previous Friday.\nAnd the Pope, in a very different, friendly, almost affectionate tone, said to me: \u201cYes, the Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized, they must not be right-wing like the Archbishop of Philadelphia, (the Pope did not give me the name of the Archbishop) they must be shepherds; and they must not be left-wing \u2014 and he added, raising both arms \u2014 and when I say left-wing I mean homosexual.\u201d Of course, the logic of the correlation between being left-wing and being homosexual escaped me, but I added nothing else.\nImmediately after, the Pope asked me in a deceitful way: \u201cWhat is Cardinal McCarrick like?\u201d I answered him with complete frankness and, if you want, with great naivet\u00e9: \u201cHoly Father, I don\u2019t know if you know Cardinal McCarrick, but if you ask the Congregation for Bishops there is a dossier this thick about him.\nHe corrupted generations of seminarians and priests and Pope Benedict ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance.\u201d The Pope did not make the slightest comment about those very grave words of mine and did not show any expression of surprise on his face, as if he had already known the matter for some time, and he immediately changed the subject.\nBut then, what was the Pope\u2019s purpose in asking me that question: \u201cWhat is Cardinal McCarrick like?\u201d He clearly wanted to find out if I was an ally of McCarrick or not.\nBack in Washington everything became very clear to me, thanks also to a new event that occurred only a few days after my meeting with Pope Francis.\nWhen the new Bishop Mark Seitz took possession of the Diocese of El Paso on July 9, 2013, I sent the first Counsellor, Monsignor Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lantheaume, while I went to Dallas that same day for an international meeting on Bioethics.\nWhen he got back, Monsignor Lantheaume told me that in El Paso he had met Cardinal McCarrick who, taking him aside, told him almost the same words that the Pope had said to me in Rome: \u201cthe Bishops in the United States must not be ideologized, they must not be right-wing, they must be shepherds\u2026.\u201d I was astounded!\nIt was therefore clear that the words of reproach that Pope Francis had addressed to me on June 21, 2013 had been put into his mouth the day before by Cardinal McCarrick.\nAlso the Pope\u2019s mention \u201cnot like the Archbishop of Philadelphia\u201d could be traced to McCarrick, because there had been a strong disagreement between the two of them about the admission to Communion of pro-abortion politicians.\nIn his communication to the bishops, McCarrick had manipulated a letter of then-Cardinal Ratzinger who prohibited giving them Communion.\nIndeed, I also knew how certain Cardinals such as Mahony, Levada and Wuerl, were closely linked to McCarrick; they had opposed the most recent appointments made by Pope Benedict, for important posts such as Philadelphia, Baltimore, Denver and San Francisco.\nNot happy with the trap he had set for me on June 23, 2013, when he asked me about McCarrick, only a few months later, in the audience he granted me on October 10, 2013, Pope Francis set a second one for me, this time concerning a second of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Cardinal Donald Wuerl.\nHe asked me: \u201cWhat is Cardinal Wuerl like, is he good or bad?\u201d I replied, \u201cHoly Father, I will not tell you if he is good or bad, but I will tell you two facts.\u201d They are the ones I have already mentioned above, which concern Wuerl\u2019s pastoral carelessness regarding the aberrant deviations at Georgetown University and the invitation by the Archdiocese of Washington to young aspirants to the priesthood to a meeting with McCarrick!\nOnce again the Pope did not show any reaction.\nIt was also clear that, from the time of Pope Francis\u2019s election, McCarrick, now free from all constraints, had felt free to travel continuously, to give lectures and interviews.\nIn a team effort with Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, he had become the kingmaker for appointments in the Curia and the United States, and the most listened to advisor in the Vatican for relations with the Obama administration.\nThis is how one explains that, as members of the Congregation for Bishops, the Pope replaced Cardinal Burke with Wuerl and immediately appointed Cupich right after he was made a cardinal.\nWith these appointments the Nunciature in Washington was now out of the picture in the appointment of bishops.\nIn addition, he appointed the Brazilian Ilson de Jesus Montanari \u2014 the great friend of his private Argentine secretary Fabian Pedacchio \u2014 as Secretary of the same Congregation for Bishops and Secretary of the College of Cardinals, promoting him in one single leap from a simple official of that department to Archbishop Secretary.\nSomething unprecedented for such an important position!\nThe appointments of Blase Cupich to Chicago and Joseph W. Tobin to Newark were orchestrated by McCarrick, Maradiaga and Wuerl, united by a wicked pact of abuses by the first, and at least of coverup of abuses by the other two.\nTheir names were not among those presented by the Nunciature for Chicago and Newark.\nRegarding Cupich, one cannot fail to note his ostentatious arrogance, and the insolence with which he denies the evidence that is now obvious to all: that 80% of the abuses found were committed against young adults by homosexuals who were in a relationship of authority over their victims.\nDuring the speech he gave when he took possession of the Chicago See, at which I was present as a representative of the Pope, Cupich quipped that one certainly should not expect the new Archbishop to walk on water.\nPerhaps it would be enough for him to be able to remain with his feet on the ground and not try to turn reality upside-down, blinded by his pro-gay ideology, as he stated in a recent interview with America Magazine.\nExtolling his particular expertise in the matter, having been President of the Committee on Protection of Children and Young People of the USCCB, he asserted that the main problem in the crisis of sexual abuse by clergy is not homosexuality, and that affirming this is only a way of diverting attention from the real problem which is clericalism.\nIn support of this thesis, Cupich \u201coddly\u201d made reference to the results of research carried out at the height of the sexual abuse of minors crisis in the early 2000s, while he \u201ccandidly\u201d ignored that the results of that investigation were totally denied by the subsequent Independent Reports by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in 2004 and 2011, which concluded that, in cases of sexual abuse, 81% of the victims were male.\nIn fact, Father Hans Zollner, S.J., Vice-Rector of the Pontifical Gregorian University, President of the Centre for Child Protection, and Member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, recently told the newspaper La Stampa that \u201cin most cases it is a question of homosexual abuse.\u201d\nThe appointment of McElroy in San Diego was also orchestrated from above, with an encrypted peremptory order to me as Nuncio, by Cardinal Parolin: \u201cReserve the See of San Diego for McElroy.\u201d McElroy was also well aware of McCarrick\u2019s abuses, as can be seen from a letter sent to him by Richard Sipe on July 28, 2016.\nThese characters are closely associated with individuals belonging in particular to the deviated wing of the Society of Jesus, unfortunately today a majority, which had already been a cause of serious concern to Paul VI and subsequent pontiffs.\nWe need only consider Father Robert Drinan, S.J., who was elected four times to the House of Representatives, and was a staunch supporter of abortion; or Father Vincent O\u2019Keefe, S.J., one of the principal promoters of The Land O\u2019Lakes Statement of 1967, which seriously compromised the Catholic identity of universities and colleges in the United States.\nIt should be noted that McCarrick, then President of the Catholic University of Puerto Rico, also participated in that inauspicious undertaking which was so harmful to the formation of the consciences of American youth, closely associated as it was with the deviated wing of the Jesuits.\nFather James Martin, S.J., acclaimed by the people mentioned above, in particular Cupich, Tobin, Farrell and McElroy, appointed Consultor of the Secretariat for Communications, well-known activist who promotes the LGBT agenda, chosen to corrupt the young people who will soon gather in Dublin for the World Meeting of Families, is nothing but a sad recent example of that deviated wing of the Society of Jesus.\nPope Francis has repeatedly asked for total transparency in the Church and for bishops and faithful to act with parrhesia.\nThe faithful throughout the world also demand this of him in an exemplary manner.\nHe must honestly state when he first learned about the crimes committed by McCarrick, who abused his authority with seminarians and priests.\nIn any case, the Pope learned about it from me on June 23, 2013 and continued to cover for him.\nHe did not take into account the sanctions that Pope Benedict had imposed on him and made him his trusted counselor along with Maradiaga.\nThe latter [Maradiaga] is so confident of the Pope\u2019s protection that he can dismiss as \u201cgossip\u201d the heartfelt appeals of dozens of his seminarians, who found the courage to write to him after one of them tried to commit suicide over homosexual abuse in the seminary.\nBy now the faithful have well understood Maradiaga\u2019s strategy: insult the victims to save himself, lie to the bitter end to cover up a chasm of abuses of power, of mismanagement in the administration of Church property, and of financial disasters even against close friends, as in the case of the Ambassador of Honduras Alejandro Valladares, former Dean of the Diplomatic Corps to the Holy See.\nIn the case of the former Auxiliary Bishop Juan Jos\u00e9 Pineda, after the article published in the [Italian] weekly L\u2019Espresso last February, Maradiaga stated in the newspaper Avvenire: \u201cIt was my auxiliary bishop Pineda who asked for the visitation, so as to \u2018clear\u2019 his name after being subjected to much slander.\u201d Now, regarding Pineda the only thing that has been made public is that his resignation has simply been accepted, thus making any possible responsibility of his and Maradiaga vanish into nowhere.\nIn the name of the transparency so hailed by the Pope, the report that the Visitator, Argentine bishop Alcides Casaretto, delivered more than a year ago only and directly to the Pope, must be made public.\nFinally, the recent appointment as Substitute of Archbishop Edgar Pe\u00f1a Parra is also connected with Honduras, that is, with Maradiaga.\nFrom 2003 to 2007 Pe\u00f1a Parra worked as Counsellor at the Tegucigalpa Nunciature.\nAs Delegate for Pontifical Representations I received worrisome information about him.\nIn Honduras, a scandal as huge as the one in Chile is about to be repeated.\nThe Pope defends his man, Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, to the bitter end, as he had done in Chile with Bishop Juan de la Cruz Barros, whom he himself had appointed Bishop of Osorno against the advice of the Chilean Bishops.\nFirst he insulted the abuse victims.\nThen, only when he was forced by the media, and a revolt by the Chilean victims and faithful, did he recognize his error and apologize, while stating that he had been misinformed, causing a disastrous situation for the Church in Chile, but continuing to protect the two Chilean Cardinals Errazuriz and Ezzati.\nEven in the tragic affair of McCarrick, Pope Francis\u2019s behavior was no different.\nHe knew from at least June 23, 2013 that McCarrick was a serial predator.\nAlthough he knew that he was a corrupt man, he covered for him to the bitter end; indeed, he made McCarrick\u2019s advice his own, which was certainly not inspired by sound intentions and for love of the Church.\nIt was only when he was forced by the report of the abuse of a minor, again on the basis of media attention, that he took action [regarding McCarrick] to save his image in the media.\nNow in the United States a chorus of voices is rising especially from the lay faithful, and has recently been joined by several bishops and priests, asking that all those who, by their silence, covered up McCarrick\u2019s criminal behavior, or who used him to advance their career or promote their intentions, ambitions and power in the Church, should resign.\nBut this will not be enough to heal the situation of extremely grave immoral behavior by the clergy: bishops and priests.\nA time of conversion and penance must be proclaimed.\nThe virtue of chastity must be recovered in the clergy and in seminaries.\nCorruption in the misuse of the Church\u2019s resources and of the offerings of the faithful must be fought against.\nThe seriousness of homosexual behavior must be denounced.\nThe homosexual networks present in the Church must be eradicated, as Janet Smith, Professor of Moral Theology at the Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit, recently wrote.\n\u201cThe problem of clergy abuse,\u201d she wrote, \u201ccannot be resolved simply by the resignation of some bishops, and even less so by bureaucratic directives.\nThe deeper problem lies in homosexual networks within the clergy which must be eradicated.\u201d These homosexual networks, which are now widespread in many dioceses, seminaries, religious orders, etc., act under the concealment of secrecy and lies with the power of octopus tentacles, and strangle innocent victims and priestly vocations, and are strangling the entire Church.\nI implore everyone, especially Bishops, to speak up in order to defeat this conspiracy of silence that is so widespread, and to report the cases of abuse they know about to the media and civil authorities.\nLet us heed the most powerful message that St. John Paul II left us as an inheritance:Do not be afraid!\nDo not be afraid!\nIn his 2008 homily on the Feast of the Epiphany, Pope Benedict reminded us that the Father\u2019s plan of salvation had been fully revealed and realized in the mystery of Christ\u2019s death and resurrection, but it needs to be welcomed in human history, which is always a history of fidelity on God\u2019s part and unfortunately also of infidelity on the part of us men.\nThe Church, the depositary of the blessing of the New Covenant, signed in the blood of the Lamb, is holy but made up of sinners, as Saint Ambrose wrote: the Church is \u201cimmaculata ex maculatis,\u201d she is holy and spotless even though, in her earthly journey, she is made up of men stained with sin.\nI want to recall this indefectible truth of the Church\u2019s holiness to the many people who have been so deeply scandalized by the abominable and sacrilegious behavior of the former Archbishop of Washington, Theodore McCarrick; by the grave, disconcerting and sinful conduct of Pope Francis and by the conspiracy of silence of so many pastors, and who are tempted to abandon the Church, disfigured by so many ignominies.\nAt the Angelus on Sunday, August 12, 2018 Pope Francis said these words: \u201cEveryone is guilty for the good he could have done and did not do ...\nIf we do not oppose evil, we tacitly feed it.\nWe need to intervene where evil is spreading; for evil spreads where daring Christians who oppose evil with good are lacking.\u201d If this is rightly to be considered a serious moral responsibility for every believer, how much graver is it for the Church\u2019s supreme pastor, who in the case of McCarrick not only did not oppose evil but associated himself in doing evil with someone he knew to be deeply corrupt.\nHe followed the advice of someone he knew well to be a pervert, thus multiplying exponentially with his supreme authority the evil done by McCarrick.\nAnd how many other evil pastors is Francis still continuing to prop up in their active destruction of the Church!\nFrancis is abdicating the mandate which Christ gave to Peter to confirm the brethren.\nIndeed, by his action he has divided them, led them into error, and encouraged the wolves to continue to tear apart the sheep of Christ\u2019s flock.\nIn this extremely dramatic moment for the universal Church, he must acknowledge his mistakes and, in keeping with the proclaimed principle of zero tolerance, Pope Francis must be the first to set a good example for cardinals and bishops who covered up McCarrick\u2019s abuses and resign along with all of them.\nEven in dismay and sadness over the enormity of what is happening, let us not lose hope!\nWe well know that the great majority of our pastors live their priestly vocation with fidelity and dedication.\nIt is in moments of great trial that the Lord\u2019s grace is revealed in abundance and makes His limitless mercy available to all; but it is granted only to those who are truly repentant and sincerely propose to amend their lives.\nThis is a favorable time for the Church to confess her sins, to convert, and to do penance.\nLet us all pray for the Church and for the Pope, let us remember how many times he has asked us to pray for him!\nLet us all renew faith in the Church our Mother: \u201cI believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church!\u201d\nChrist will never abandon His Church!\nHe generated her in His Blood and continually revives her with His Spirit!\nMary, Mother of the Church, pray for us!\nMary, Virgin and Queen, Mother of the King of glory, pray for us!\nRome, August 22, 2018\nQueenship of the Blessed Virgin Mary\nOfficial translation by Diane Montagna.\n", ["Repetition", "Appeal_to_fear-prejudice", "Exaggeration,Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling,Labeling", "Slogans"]], ["Muslim Leader Calls for Conquest of \u201cAmerica, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy\u201d\nRecently a Muslim spokesman in Tunisia named Said Khecharem, who is affiliated with the international pro-Sharia, pro-caliphate organization Hizb ut-Tahrir, declared (to delighted screams of \u201cAllahu akbar\u201d from his audience), that the \u201cestablishment of an Islamic state\u2026requires the conquest of America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy \u2013 Rome and other infidel lands will be conquered, Allah willing.\u201d\nAccording to the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI), Khecharem also said: \u201cAfter the laws of Allah were abandoned, and the heretic regimes were imposed on the Muslims, the most important thing to do is to restore the rule of the Muslims, through the Quran and the Sunna, in order to renew Islamic life and to deliver the Islamic message to the world.\nMy brothers, the implication of this today should be the establishment of an Islamic state over all the lands of the Muslims.\u201d\n\ufeff\ntake our poll - story continues below\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme Court?\nWill Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the Supreme

course, after the elimination of the filthy Jewish entity, and after liberation of the lands under direct colonization, like Kashmir and others.\u201d\nIf Said Khecharem were a non-Muslim saying that Muslims needed to destroy \u201cthe filthy Jewish entity\u201d and conquer America, Britain, Russia, France, and Italy, he would be accused of \u201cIslamophobia\u201d and \u201cbigotry.\u201d But no one will take any particular notice of this.\nThey should, however.\nKhecharem is not some deluded fanatic raving on a Tunisian street corner.\nHe was speaking at Hizb ut-Tahrir\u2019s International Caliphate Conference; although Hizb ut-Tahrir is banned in many countries, it still has an international presence, and recently held a conference in Chicago.\nNor is the desire to establish a global caliphate limited to Hizb ut-Tahrir alone.\nThe word khalifa means \u201csuccessor\u201d; the caliph in Sunni Islamic theology is the successor of Muhammad as the military, political, and spiritual leader of the Muslims.\nAs I show in my book The History of Jihad From Muhammad to ISIS , the great caliphates of history, from the immediate post-Muhammad period of the \u201cRightly Guided Caliphs\u201d to the Umayyads, Abbasids, and Ottomans, as well as other Islamic states, all waged relentless jihad warfare against non-Muslims, subjugating them under the rule of Islamic law and denying them basic rights.\nThese weren\u2019t the actions of a \u201ctiny minority of extremists,\u201d abhorred by the vast majority of peaceful Muslims for \u201chijacking\u201d their religion.\nThis was, for fourteen centuries, mainstream, normative Islam, carried forth by the primary authorities in the Islamic world at the time.\nThe History of Jihad shows from the accounts of eyewitnesses and contemporary chroniclers through the ages that in every age and in every place where there were Muslims, some of them believed that they had a responsibility given to them by Allah to wage war against and subjugate unbelievers under the rule of Islamic law.\nAnd so it is today: Said Khecharem has enunciated that responsibility more clearly and directly than most Muslim spokesmen do these days, but he is by no means the only one who believes that it exists.\nWhat is noteworthy also about The History of Jihad is something that it does not contain.\nAs the jihadis move against non-Muslim states without any letup, pause, period of coexistence, period of tolerance, reformation, or reconsideration, there never appears any force of Muslims to oppose them.\nWhile it is undoubtedly true that not all Muslims in any given age have ever waged jihad, there has never been in Islamic history an Islamic entity or organization that was opposed to waging jihad and dedicated to stopping those who were waging it.\nSo it is today.\nIslamic groups in the West issue pro-forma condemnations after every jihad terror attack, but are doing little or nothing to try to prevent the next one.\nThere is still no mosque or Islamic school in the United States that teaches young Muslims why they should reject the understanding of Islam taught by al-Qaeda, ISIS, and other jihad terror groups.\nMeanwhile, Said Khecharem and other Islamic spokesmen openly call for Muslims to engage in jihad conquest.\nWestern authorities should be pondering his words, and their implications, very carefully.\nInstead, if they have taken any notice of him at all, which is unlikely, they have dismissed him as an \u201cextremist.\u201d\nThey have yet to come to grips with the fact that \u201cextremism\u201d is and always has been so distressingly widespread in Muslim communities.\nBut they will.\nArticle posted with permission from Robert Spencer\n", ["Appeal_to_fear-prejudice",

oath, the Archbishop, marking a turning point in Church history, declares that senior Vatican officials, including former Secretaries of State Angelo Sodano and Tarcisio Bertone as well as Cardinal \u00d3scar Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez Maradiaga, coordinator of Pope Bergoglio\u2019s \u201cCouncil of Cardinals\u201d, covered up McCarrick\u2019s decades of sexual predation and that Bergoglio himself continued the coverup.\nThis article was first written to address the neo-Catholic commentator Massimo Faggioli\u2019s attempt , following the Pennsylvania grand jury report and the fall of ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, to minimize the homosexual crisis in the Church and blunt the correlative rise of what he derides as \u201cneo-traditionalism.\u201d As my piece was about to go to press, however, EWTN\u2019s National Catholic Register broke the explosive story on the written testimony of Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2 , former apostolic nuncio to the United States (2011 to 2016).\nFaggioli\u2019s propaganda piece now becomes merely illustrative of the points to be made here in light of this astonishing and indeed providential development.\nRegarding Bergoglio, Vigan\u00f2 testifies that in 2013 he personally informed him about McCarrick\u2019s history, the dossier of the Congregation for Bishops on his sexual crimes against boys and young men, and the disciplinary sanctions imposed upon him by Benedict XVI (forbidding residence in a seminary, public appearances and Masses).\nEvidently already aware of these facts, however, Bergoglio not only rehabilitated McCarrick but made him a \u201ctrusted counselor\u201d who advised the elevation of the pro-homosexual prelates Blase Cupich, Joseph Tobin and Kevin Farrell to the College of Cardinals and the prominent episcopal sees they now discredit.\nAll of this happened before Bergoglio, bowing to worldwide public pressure, finally\u2014only weeks ago\u2014took decisive action against his \u201ctrusted counselor.\u201d McCarrick had lobbied for Bergoglio\u2019s election, along with Maradiaga and the infamous Cardinal Danneels, who covered up homosexual rape committed by a priest against his own nephew,has supported \u201csame-sex marriage,\u201d and advised the King of Belgium to sign a law legalizing abortion in 1990.\nAs Edward Pentin notes: \u201call 3 prelates have since been special advisors of Francis or rehabilitated by him.\u201d\nVigan\u00f2 concludes his testimony by declaring that all of the prelates involved (many others are implicated), including Bergoglio, should resign their offices for the good of the Church.\nAs to Bergoglio in particular, he courageously states openly the truth that so many of his brethren know but fear to speak in public:\nI want to recall this indefectible truth of the Church\u2019s holiness to the many people who have been so deeply scandalized by the abominable and sacrilegious behavior of the former Archbishop of

the evil done by McCarrick.\nAnd how many other evil pastors is Francis still continuing to prop up in their active destruction of the Church!\n[my emphasis] Francis is abdicating the mandate which Christ gave to Peter to confirm the brethren.\nIndeed, by his action he has divided them, led them into error, and encouraged the wolves to continue to tear apart the sheep of Christ\u2019s flock.\nIn this extremely dramatic moment for the universal Church, he must acknowledge his mistakes and, in keeping with the proclaimed principle of zero tolerance, Pope Francis must be the first to set a good example for cardinals and bishops who covered up McCarrick\u2019s abuses and resign along with all of them.\n[emphasis in original]\nBefore he was papal nuncio in Washington, Vigan\u00f2 headed the Governorate of Vatican City State after having served as Nuncio in Nigeria, a Delegate for the Pontifical Representatives of the Secretary of State of the Holy See and a Member of the Disciplinary Commission of the Roman Curia.\nIn those capacities he had access to documents and witnesses that corroborate his own firsthand testimony.\nWith Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony, the widespread homosexual infiltration of the post-Vatican II hierarchy, from the top on down, now emerges mountainously into view, never to be buried again.\nEven before that testimony, however, the fall of McCarrick and the Pennsylvania grand jury report had already presented a Sisyphean task to neo-Catholic apologists for the decrepit Novus Ordo status quo and the ill-starred Council that launched its installation.\nYet there is little doubt they will continue the same polemic that for nearly sixty years has doggedly defended every one of the ruinous \u201creforms\u201d that have resulted in a debacle without equal in Church history, even considering the Arian crisis of the 4th century.\nThose \u201creforms\u201d included abandonment of the Vatican\u2019s strict pre-conciliar instruction (1961) that \u201cadvancement to religious vows and ordination should be barred to those who are afflicted with evil tendencies to homosexuality or pederasty, since for them the common life and the priestly ministry would constitute serious dangers.\u201d Today, neo-Catholic commentators, cowed by the demands of political correctness, refuse to state the simple truth that homosexuality is a perversion that precludes ordination as does any other grave psychological disorder.\nKill the Messenger\nI suspect that not even Vigan\u00f2\u2019s historic testimony will change the neo-Catholic position.\nQuite the contrary, I would expect the neo-Catholic commentariat either to ignore Vigan\u00f2\u2019s witness, explain away his revelations or, failing that, make every effort to smear the man.\nThe campaign to discredit Archbishop Vigan\u00f2 began instantaneously on the Catholic left wing.\nOnly hours after Vigan\u00f2\u2019s sworn testimony appeared online, the professional Catholic dissident Sean Michael Winters, writing for National Catholic Reporter, smeared the former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, who holds doctorates in both civil and canon law, as \u201ca trafficker in conspiracy theories who mixes fact, fiction and venom,\u201d \u201cmore than a little obsessed with homosexuality\u201d\u2014like Oliver Stone, who \u201cwas obsessed with the grassy knoll\u201d\u2014\u201ca disgruntled former employee\u201d and \u201calways a crackpot.\u201d Without addressing the merits, Winters dismissed Archbishop Vigan\u00f2\u2019s \u201cwild claims\u201d about bishops who are \u201csubverting Catholic doctrine on homosexuality\u201d and accused the Archbishop, along with unnamed other bishops and archbishops, of \u201cspeak[ing] about gay people with such hatred\u2026\u201d\nWinters issues the dire warning that \u201cA putsch is afoot and if the U.S. bishops do not, as a body, stand up to defend the Holy Father in the next 24 hours, we shall be slipping towards schism long before the bishops\u2019 meeting in November.\nThe enemies of Francis have declared war.\u201d Notice that for Winters it is not the Church or the integrity of her doctrine and discipline that must be defended against enemies, but only Bergoglio and the regime of novelty he is leading to its final extremity.\nJohn Allen\u2019s instant analysis attempting to impeach Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony is, as one would expect from him, a bit craftier.\nHis opinion is: \u201cTake it seriously, but with a large grain of salt.\u201d Which is just Allen\u2019s more nuanced way of saying: \u201cDon\u2019t believe it.\u201d Allen\u2019s view is supported by such irrelevancies as the fact that Vigan\u00f2\u2019s account implicates \u201cno fewer than 32 senior churchmen\u201d (so what?\n), that he \u201chas a history\u201d of \u201cinnuendo and conspiracy theories\u201d (a gratuitous assertion unsupported by evidence of falsity), that he allegedly quashed an investigation of Archbishop John Nienstedt and ordered evidence destroyed (an allegation Vigan\u00f2 has immediately and categorically denied with conclusive supporting documents, but in any event a tuo quoque fallacy) and that Allen has \u201cthe impression that all this was orchestrated with a political agenda in mind\u201d (the same \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d mentality he gratuitously attributes to Vigan\u00f2).\nMark Shea, easily the most insufferable of the neo-Catholic polemicists, has quickly followed Winters and Allen in trying to cast doubt on Vigan\u00f2 \u2019s claims.\nIgnoring eleven pages of detail, written and published under oath, he suggests there has been no \u201cDocumentation.\nEvidence.\nProof.\u201d Yes, Francis should resign if Vigan\u00f2 \u2019s allegations are true, Shea admits\u2014a stunning concession coming from him.\nYet, making no attempt to refute Vigan\u00f2\u2019s account on the merits, he tries to wave it all aside with his usual mode of argument\u2014puerile mockery: \u201cBut at present, the eagerness of the Greatest Catholics of All Time to believe and repeat everything their itching ears want to hear about this Pope whose living guts they have hated from the moment of his election only tells in his favor, not against it.\u201d Shea\u2019s ever-expanding opus of digital invective never seems to rise above this sort of crude ad hominem attack: Well, if those people believe it, it can\u2019t be true.\nThe neo-Catholic propaganda mill will have a very difficult time smearing this witness, however.\nSpeaking to Catholic News Agency, Monsignor Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lantheaume, who served as first Counsellor of the Nunciature in Washington, confirmed that \u201cVigan\u00f2 said the truth.\nThat\u2019s all,\u201d when he stated in his sworn account that Nuncio Pietro Sambi conveyed to McCarrick at the Nunciature in Washington the sanctions that had been imposed on him by Pope Benedict\u2014sanctions Bergoglio ignored for five years until forced to act by a worldwide storm of outrage.\nFurthermore, a series of prelates has vouched for Vigan\u00f2\u2019s character and credibility:\n- Bishop Joseph Strickland of Tyler, Texas has gone so far as to order all the priests in his diocese to read from the pulpit a statement that he finds Vigan\u00f2\u2019s allegations credible.\n- Bishop Thomas Olmsted of Phoenix, Arizona, issued a statement affirming that he has known Vigan\u00f2 for 39 years, has \u201calways known and respected him as a man of truthfulness, faith and integrity\u201d and that his testimony should \u201cbe taken seriously by all\u2026\u201d\n- Archbishop Allen Vigneron of Detroit, Michigan issued a statement calling Vigan\u00f2\u2019s account \u201canother daunting challenge to our confidence in the reliability of the Church\u2019s leadership, during a summer of devastating news regarding clergy sexual abuse and infidelity.\u201d (The statement has since apparently been scrubbed from the diocesan website.)\n- Bishop Athanasius Schneider declares: \u201cArchbishop Vigan\u00f2 confirmed his statement by a sacred oath invoking the name of God.\nThere is, therefore, no reasonable and plausible cause to doubt the truth content of the document of Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2.\u201d\n- Cardinal Raymond Burke\u2019s statement declares: \u201cThe declarations made by a prelate of the authority of Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2 must be totally taken to heart by those responsible in the Church.\u201d\n- [And just two days ago, Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone of San Francisco wrote a letter to his faithful which \"speaks to Vigano's integrity and sincere love of the Church.\"]\nIn another setback for the propaganda machine gearing up to impeach Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony, the Catholic Herald has just reported that Cardinal Wuerl must have known full well from Vigan\u00f2 himself that McCarrick was under Pope Benedict\u2019s papal sanctions on account of his sexual misconduct because, as an Archdiocesan spokesman now confirms, at Vigan\u00f2\u2019s request as then papal nuncio Wuerl had to cancel a public appearance by McCarrick not long before Bergoglio\u2019s election.\nThe Herald asks the obvious question: \u201c[I]f Cardinal Wuerl was unaware of the sanctions, and unaware of the reason for them, why did he ask no questions of the nuncio regarding the reason for his demand?\u201d The question answers itself, and Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony on this critical point stands confirmed by Wuerl\u2019s own spokesman.\nBergoglio Pleads the Fifth\nBergoglio himself, however, has already precluded any attempt to impeach Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony.\nDuring the return flight from Dublin after the \u201cWorld Meeting of Familes,\u201d he was asked to comment on Vigan\u00f2 \u2019s allegations that he had informed Bergoglio of McCarrick\u2019s crimes in 2013 as well as the sanctions imposed by Benedict.\nBergoglio declined to incriminate himself:\nRead the statement carefully yourselves and make your own judgment.\nI am not going to say a word about this.\nI believe that the statement speaks for itself, and you all have sufficient journalistic ability to draw conclusions.\nIt is an act of trust.\nWhen a little time goes by, and you have drawn conclusions, perhaps I will speak about it, but I would like your professional maturity to do this work.\nIt will do you all good, really.\nIn other words, as Bergoglio cannot deny the allegations without lying, he will say nothing at all about them in the hope they will go away\u2014with the help of sycophants in the Vatican press corps and shifty polemicists like Shea, who expects his readers to swallow his explanation that Bergoglio\u2019s refusal to say anything in his defense when asked point blank about the charges against him \u201cseems to me to obviously be the reply of somebody who believes the accusations are groundless\u2026\u201d.\nSeems to be.\nObviously.\nThe American \u201cGay\u201d Church Expansion\nWhile events have overtaken Faggioli\u2019s piece, it will remain useful here as a prime example of the neo-Catholic polemic.\nThat polemic seeks to shore up the collapsing Novus Ordo establishment lest it give way to the dreaded traditionalist revival.\nBut before I address Faggioli\u2019s latest defense of the indefensible, some background is in order, including a discussion of further key details of Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony.\nFirst of all, as I predicted 16 years ago, because the Vatican under John Paul II had no intention of enforcing the pre-conciliar ban on admission of homosexuals to the seminary \u201ca new bumper crop of homosexual ordinands is guaranteed\u2014and with it a new harvest of scandal for the Church.\u201d That prediction came immediately after the \u201cpedophile summit\u201d of 2002 in Rome, which I attended as The Remnant\u2019s correspondent.\nIn answer to my question then head of the USCCB, Wilton Gregory, made an explosive admission reportedby the international press: \u201cit is an ongoing struggle to make sure that the Catholic priesthood is not dominated by homosexual men.\u201d The struggle, to the extent there even was one, obviously has been lost.\nSixteen years later, the homosexual predator McCarrick has finally been exposed to the world, stripped of his cardinal\u2019s hat and deprived of any ministry, but only after international media coverage of the Vatican\u2019s semi-secret finding that McCarrick had raped a teenage altar boy 47 years ago.\nIf not for that one case, McCarrick\u2019s sixty years of homosexual debauchery might well have gone unpunished in this world and he would have died still possessed of all the phony honors that had been heaped upon him throughout his career as a parasite in the Body of Christ, including the favor shown to him by Bergoglio.\nThe telling details of Archbishop Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony concerning Bergoglio\u2019s friendly relations with McCarrick before he finally had to cut him loose\u2014details conveniently ignored by Winters, Allen and Shea\u2014are utterly devastating to any defense of Bergoglio.\nThis would explain why he will not a \u201csay a word about\u201d Vigan\u00f2\u2019s charges against him.\nThe Archbishop reveals, as already noted, that Pope Benedict imposed sanctions on McCarrick under which he \u201cwas to leave the seminary where he was living, he was forbidden to celebrate [Mass] in public, to participate in public meetings, to give lectures, to travel, with the obligation of dedicating himself to a life of prayer and penance.\u201d Vigan\u00f2 further reveals that those sanctions were communicated to McCarrick by then Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, Pietro Sambi, but were also repeated by Vigan\u00f2 himself when he succeeded Sambi as Nuncio:\nI repeated them to Cardinal McCarrick at my first meeting with him at the Nunciature.\nThe Cardinal, muttering in a barely comprehensible way, admitted that he had perhaps made the mistake of sleeping in the same bed with some seminarians at his beach house, but he said this as if it had no importance.\nVigan\u00f2 testifies that on June 23, 2013, he obtained a private audience with Bergoglio after having encountered McCarrick at the Pope\u2019s residence three days earlier, during which encounter McCarrick had told him with an air of triumph: \u201cThe Pope received me yesterday, tomorrow I am going to China\u201d (evidently to assist in negotiating Bergoglio\u2019s planned sellout of China\u2019s underground Catholics to the Communist dictators of Beijing).\nVigan\u00f2 wanted to know why McCarrick had apparently been relieved of the sanctions.\nDuring the audience Bergoglio queried: \u201cWhat is Cardinal McCarrick like?\u201d and Vigan\u00f2 replied with the truth Bergoglio obviously did not want to hear:\nI answered him with complete frankness and, if you want, with great naivet\u00e9: \u201cHoly Father, I don\u2019t know if you know Cardinal McCarrick, but if you ask the Congregation for Bishops there is a dossier this thick about him.\nHe corrupted generations of seminarians and priests and Pope Benedict ordered him to withdraw to a life of prayer and penance.\u201d The Pope did not make the slightest comment about those very grave words of mine and did not show any expression of surprise on his face, as if he had already known the matter for some time, and he immediately changed the subject.\nBut then, what was the Pope\u2019s purpose in asking me that question: \u201cWhat is Cardinal McCarrick like?\u201d He clearly wanted to find out if I was an ally of McCarrick or not\u2026.\nIt was also clear that, from the time of Pope Francis\u2019s election, McCarrick, now free from all constraints, had felt free to travel continuously, to give lectures and interviews\u2026.\nHe [Bergoglio] knew from at least June 23, 2013 [the date of the audience with Vigan\u00f2] that McCarrick was a serial predator.\nAlthough he knew that he was a corrupt man, he covered for him to the bitter end; indeed, he made McCarrick\u2019s advice his own, which was certainly not inspired by sound intentions and for love of the Church.\nIt was only when he was forced by the report of the abuse of a minor, again on the basis of media attention, that he took action to save his image in the media.\n[all emphasis in original]\nBefore his long overdue fall McCarrick, as Bergoglio\u2019s \u201ctrusted counselor,\u201d had been instrumental in cementing into place the homosexual-friendly status quo of the American episcopate that oppresses and defrauds the faithful.\nIt was McCarrick, noted Marco Tosatti, who was behind the elevation of Blase Cupich to the key position of Archbishop of Chicago, where Cupich has since promoted the homosexual subversion of Father James Martin.\nAnd Vigan\u00f2 now confirms Tosatti\u2019s allegation: \u201cThe appointments of Blase Cupich to Chicago and Joseph W. Tobin to Newark were orchestrated by McCarrick, Maradiaga and Wuerl, united by a wicked pact of abuses by the first, and at least of coverup of abuses by the other two.\nTheir names were not among those presented by the Nunciature for Chicago and Newark.\u201d That is, the normal process was circumvented for these appointments.\nRemnant readers may recall that I spotted Cupich back in 2002, when he was the obscure Bishop of Rapid City, South Dakota, as an example of what was coming in the Novus Ordo: accelerated degeneration.\nAs I wrote back then, with the likes of Cupich in view:\nCupich is the very model of a Novus Ordo bishop.\nHe is the very exemplar of the crisis we must still endure\u2026.\nLet the thing die of its own excesses, for as the \u201clittle synod\u201d [the 2002 \u201cpedophile summit\u201d] demonstrates, the men who control this establishment will never restore it to anything resembling the vibrant Church that a long line of militant, uncompromising Popes delivered into their hands at Vatican II.\nFor heaven\u2019s sake, the men who govern the Church today require a Vatican summit meeting to agonize over whether serial child molesters should be defrocked.\nFrom the Vatican on down, through deliberate decisions and criminal neglect, the servitors of Vatican II have laid waste to the liturgy, the perennial clarity of Catholic teaching, the Church\u2019s militant opposition to worldly thinking, the traditional formation in seminaries, the religious orders, the missions, the trust of the faithful in their own priests\u2014in short, the very life of the Church\u2014and dare to call it a renewal.\nWe must no longer subsidize the malpractice of the architects of ruin.\nNor must we join the neo-Catholics in their mindless applause when one of these incompetents attempts to repoint a brick or two in the crumbling fa\u00e7ade they have erected to obscure the Church of old.\nAs for William (\u201cnighty-night baby!\u201d) Tobin, after McCarrick had arranged for him to become Archbishop of Newark, Tobin, another episcopal booster of Martin\u2019s pro-homosexual propaganda, promptly sponsored a \u201cgay pilgrimage\u201d to his cathedral in Newark.\nAnd it was McCarrick who obtained the cardinal\u2019s hat for his roommate of six years, Kevin Farrell, whom he consecrated a bishop.\nFarrell, yet another promoter of Martin\u2019s homosexual activism, arranged for Martin to \u201cwelcome \u2018gay\u2019 families\u201d at the \u201cWorld Meeting of Families\u201d in Dublin from which Bergoglio has just returned.\nFinally, there is the appointment of the \u201cpro-gay\u201d Robert McElroy as Bishop of San Diego, concerning which Vigan\u00f2 reveals: \u201cThe appointment of McElroy in San Diego was also orchestrated from above, with an encrypted peremptory order to me as Nuncio, by Cardinal Parolin: \u2018Reserve the See of San Diego for McElroy.\u2019 McElroy was also well aware of McCarrick\u2019s abuses, as can be seen from a letter sent to him by Richard Sipe on July 28, 2016.\u201d Like Cupich, Tobin and Farrell, McElroy is an avid promoter of Martin\u2019s homosexual subversion of the Church, calling opposition to Martin symptomatic of a \u201ccancer of vilification [that] is seeping into the institutional life of the church.\u201d\nEmboldened by the certainty that he will face no discipline whatsoever, Martin, now backed by \u201cCupich, Tobin, Farrell and McElroy,\u201d as Vigan\u00f2 testifies, is urging all the \u201cgay priests\u201d to \u201ccome out,\u201d including those ordained since the useless \u201cpedophile summit\u201d presided over by none other than McCarrick as the classic fox in charge of the hen house.\nBut Bergoglio has also lent his own authority to Martin\u2019s effort to mainstream homosexuality in the Church.\nAs Vigan\u00f2 notes, it was Bergoglio who made Martin a \u201cConsultor of the Secretariat for Communications,\u201d even though he is a \u201cwell-known activist who promotes the LGBT agenda, chosen to corrupt the young people who will soon gather in Dublin for the World Meeting of Families\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFather\u201d Martin now confidently declares, sixteen years after the \u201cpedophile summit,\u201d that \u201cThe idea of a purge of gay priests is both ridiculous and dangerous.\nAny purge would empty parishes and religious orders of the thousands of priests and bishops who lead healthy lives of service and faithful lives of celibacy.\u201d\nMartin thus revels in smug certitude that the future of the universal Church is in the hands of legions of intrinsically disordered homosexual bishops and priests and their homosexual successors, who will perpetuate an existing worldwide homosexual network, and that there is absolutely nothing we can or should do about it.\nA Worldwide Network of Corruption, Beginning at the Top\nNone of the foregoing is meant to suggest that the homosexual invasion of the Catholic hierarchy is confined to American prelates and priests.\nThe spread of clerical sodomy has not respected national boundaries but rather extends throughout the Church under the eyes of a Vatican apparatus that is itself thoroughly infested with homosexuals.\nThis is thanks in large measure to Bergoglio, who made a flagrantly active homosexual, Monsignor Battista Ricca, \u201cprelate of the gay lobby,\u201d no less than head of his papal household.\nMoreover, it was Bergoglio\u2019s right hand man, Cardinal Maradiaga, who sheltered his friend, Juan Jos\u00e9 Pineda, auxiliary Bishop of Tegucigalpa, from any discipline over his notorious homosexual liaisons with seminarians in that diocese.\nWhen an apostolic visitation, compelled by mounting public pressure, confirmed the charges against Pineda, he was forced to resign, even as Maradiaga dismissed the incontestable proofs against him as \u201cslander.\u201d Vigan\u00f2 notes that \u201cthe only thing that has been made public is that his resignation has simply been accepted, thus making any possible responsibility of his and Maradiaga vanish into nowhere.\u201d\nDespite the fall of his friend Pineda, Maradiaga continues todefend and protect the homosexual corruption of his own seminary, involving incontrovertible evidence of rampant sodomy among the seminarians he refuses to dismiss, rejecting all the evidence as \u201cgossip.\u201d Concerning Maradiaga, who is also mired in financial corruption for which he offers no credible explanation, Vigan\u00f2 provides this withering assessment of the man and his relation to Bergoglio:\nIn a team effort with Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, [McCarrick] had become the kingmaker for appointments in the Curia and the United States, and the most listened to advisor in the Vatican for relations with the Obama administration.\nThis is how one explains that, as members of the Congregation for Bishops, the Pope replaced Cardinal Burke with Wuerl and immediately appointed Cupich right after he was made a cardinal.\nWith these appointments the Nunciature in Washington was now out of the picture in the appointment of bishops\u2026.. By now the faithful have well understood Maradiaga\u2019s strategy: insult the victims to save himself, lie to the bitter end to cover up a chasm of abuses of power, of mismanagement in the administration of Church property, and of financial disasters even against close friends, as in the case of the Ambassador of Honduras Alejandro Valladares, former Dean of the Diplomatic Corps to the Holy See\u2026.\nThe Pope defends his man, Cardinal Rodriguez Maradiaga, to the bitter end, as he had done in Chile with Bishop Juan de la Cruz Barros, whom he himself had appointed Bishop of Osorno against the advice of the Chilean Bishops.\nFirst, he insulted the abuse victims.\nThen, only when he was forced by the media, and a revolt by the Chilean victims and faithful, did he recognize his error and apologize, while stating that he had been misinformed, causing a disastrous situation for the Church in Chile, but continuing to protect the two Chilean Cardinals Errazuriz and Ezzati.\nOn the very day Archbishop Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony was made public, Sandro Magister summed up the entire state of affairs in the Church universal after decades of unrestricted homosexual migration into the hierarchy, to which Bergoglio has contributed mightily: \u201cFrom the seminaries, to the clergy, to the bishops, to the cardinals, homosexuals are present at all levels, by the thousand.\u201d\nArchbishop Vigan\u00f2 now provides his own decisive summary of the situation, based on firsthand experience with a now endemic homosexual corruption of the Church:\nJanet Smith, Professor of Moral Theology at the Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit, recently wrote: \u201cThe problem of clergy abuse cannot be resolved simply by the resignation of some bishops, and even less so by bureaucratic directives.\nThe deeper problem lies in homosexual networks within the clergy which must be eradicated.\u201d These homosexual networks, which are now widespread in many dioceses, seminaries, religious orders, etc., act under the concealment of secrecy and lies with the power of octopus tentacles, and strangle innocent victims and priestly vocations, and are strangling the entire Church.\n[emphasis added]\nDefending the Council by Defending the Homosexual Status Quo\nAt this moment, the entire Novus Ordo regime of novelty is threatened with collapse on account of its homosexual corruption, and voices throughout the Catholic world are now echoing Archbishop Vigan\u00f2\u2019s call for Bergoglio\u2019s resignation, including Laura Ingraham: \u201cToo little, too late from Pope Francis in Ireland.\nI stand with Archbishop Carlo Vigano.\nTime for the laity to demand a new Shepherd.\u201d Even Michael Voris, in a highly amusing example of leading from behind, has finally abandoned his absurd refusal to criticize this pontificate and now declares with a screaming headline: \u201cPope Francis Must Resign.\u201d\nNearly three years ago, seeing what was certainly coming on the disastrous course Bergoglio had already clearly established, this newspaper published a petition which states: \u201cWe your subjects respectfully petition Your Holiness to change course for the good of the Church and the welfare of souls.\nFailing this, would it not be better for Your Holiness to renounce the Petrine office than to preside over what threatens to be a catastrophic compromise of the Church\u2019s integrity?\u201d Our petition was of course dismissed as \u201cridiculous\u201d by the neo-Catholic commentariat.\nToday, our ridiculous suggestion is the stuff of mainstream news.\nFrom the neo-Catholic perspective, the events of recent days present a terrifying prospect: the final collapse of the Novus Ordo establishment, an end to the conciliar aggiornamento and a revival of integral Tradition, which growing numbers of young people are seeking.\nHence even before Archbishop Vigan\u00f2 had come forward, commentators like Faggioli were already sounding the neo-Catholic air raid siren.\nFaggioli fretted that \u201c[t]he abuse scandal and delegitimization of the episcopate has created a great power vacuum in the Church\u201d that could be filled by the \u201cneo-traditionalist Catholicism of the younger generations of American Catholics\u201d who \u201cattack American bishops and cardinals close to Pope Francis.\u201d Accordingly, he rushed to the defense of Bergoglio and his corrupt regime against \u201ca radicalization of religious conservatism in the neo-traditionalism sense...\u201d\nFor Faggioli, not only would Bergoglio\u2019s resignation be unthinkable, so also would a purge of the homosexual and pro-homosexual prelates Bergoglio and his Vatican henchmen have systematically enabled.\nThe Pope, he argues, is not \u201cthe CEO of the Catholic Church world, and the bishops as its managers whom the Pope can simply fire.\u201d No, Bergoglio cannot \u201csimply fire\u201d bishops.\nExcept whenever he pleases, as we have seen again and again with the conservative bishops and even Cardinals (Burke and M\u00fcller) he has sacked because their conservatism offended him or one of his friends, prompting even Crux to ask: \u201cDoes Pope Francis have an enemies list?\u201d Then again, Francis even obtained the removal of his own \u201ctrusted counselor\u201d McCarrick from the College of Cardinals, albeit only when forced to act due to worldwide condemnation in the media.\nSo, according to Faggioli, the same Pope who sacks conservative bishops and cardinals according to his pleasure and has just removed a cardinal from the College of Cardinals in an unprecedented disciplinary act under fire from the media, is somehow powerless to dismiss Modernist bishops who have created an obscene \u201cgay culture\u201d in the Church and replace them with orthodox, normal heterosexual males.\nFrancis cannot \u201csimply fire\u201d even Cardinal Wuerl, who covered up crimes of homosexual predation by the priests he transferred elsewhere while Archbishop of Pittsburgh, and who authorized payment of $900,000 in hush money to bury sexual abuse claims against a homosexual priest involved in the production of child pornography.\nWuerl, says Faggioli, \u201cfaces a complex situation: on the one hand Wuerl was not afraid of clashing with the tribunal over the Apostolic Signatura in the Vatican which wanted to readmit a priest from the Pittsburgh diocese to ministry\u2026 while in other cases he seems to have collaborated in covering up some cases\u2026 It is a very difficult position also because Wuerl became a symbol\u2026 beyond the specific accusations against him, from which he could not publicly defend himself.\u201d\nIn other words, because his situation is \u201ccomplex\u201d Wuerl, unlike McCarrick, should remain a cardinal and the Archbishop of Washington, DC, thus maintaining a key bulwark against the \u201cneo-traditionalist\u201d threat.\nYet, as the Pennsylvania grand jury report documents, Wuerl assisted McCarrick in the coverup of his crimes and now brazenly lies about it.\nHere too Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony sheds light on the darkness:\n\u2026.\nI myself brought up the subject [of McCarrick] with Cardinal Wuerl on several occasions, and I certainly didn\u2019t need to go into detail because it was immediately clear to me that he was fully aware of it.\nI also remember in particular the fact that I had to draw his attention to it, because I realized that in an archdiocesan publication, on the back cover in color, there was an announcement inviting young men who thought they had a vocation to the priesthood to a meeting with Cardinal McCarrick.\nI immediately phoned Cardinal Wuerl, who expressed his surprise to me, telling me that he knew nothing about that announcement and that he would cancel it.\nIf, as he now continues to state, he knew nothing of the abuses committed by McCarrick and the measures taken by Pope Benedict, how can his answer be explained?\nHis recent statements that he knew nothing about it, even though at first he cunningly referred to compensation for the two victims, are absolutely laughable.\nThe Cardinal lies shamelessly and prevails upon his Chancellor, Monsignor Antonicelli, to lie as well.\nCardinal Wuerl also clearly lied on another occasion.\nFollowing a morally unacceptable event authorized by the academic authorities of Georgetown University, I brought it to the attention of its President, Dr. John DeGioia, sending him two subsequent letters.\nBefore forwarding them to the addressee, so as to handle things properly, I personally gave a copy of them to the Cardinal with an accompanying letter I had written.\nThe Cardinal told me that he knew nothing about it.\nHowever, he failed to acknowledge receipt of my two letters, contrary to what he customarily did.\nI subsequently learned that the event at Georgetown had taken place for seven years.\nBut the Cardinal knew nothing about it!\nCardinal Wuerl, well aware of the continuous abuses committed by Cardinal McCarrick and the sanctions imposed on him by Pope Benedict, transgressing the Pope\u2019s order, also allowed him to reside at a seminary in Washington D.C.\nIn doing so, he put other seminarians at risk.\n[emphasis in original]\nWhat really concerns Faggioli and those who think like him is not Wuerl and his \u201ccomplex situation,\u201d which is not complex at all.\nRather, what he views with alarm as an \u201cessential element\u201d of the context in which Wuerl operates is that \u201cscandals are also the opportunity for the neo-traditionalist Catholicism of the younger generations of American Catholics to attack American bishops and cardinals close to Pope Francis\u2026.\u201d Better a thousand septuagenarian Wuerls in their lavish sties of corruption, financed by the faithful, than a single, young neo-traditionalist prelate!\nBut what exactly is a neo-traditionalist?\nQuite simply: an orthodox Catholic who has had enough of the homosexual-infested regime of novelty imposed on the Church by the old men of the Council, Bergoglio merely being the latest, the highest placed, and one of the last.\nAs Faggioli puts it: \u201cIn the last fifteen years, the American Catholic Church has been traversed by a radicalization of religious conservatism in the neo-traditionalism sense, especially in the younger generations of priests and intellectuals.\nThey interpret the current abuse crisis as fruit of the mistakes of the Council itself and not only of the post-Council\u2026\u201d\nJust as Faggioli fears, many in the up-and-coming generation of Catholic clergy and laity recognize the obvious: that the conciliar texts, for all their prolix repetition of traditional teaching, opened the way to ecclesial disaster.\nBecause in those texts\u2014above all Gaudium et Spes, Dignitatis Humanae, Unitatis Redintegratio, Nostra Aetate and Sacrosanctum Concilium\u2014the Council verbally prostrated itself before \u201cthe modern world\u201d and the practitioners of other religions while authorizing Bugnini (Secretary of the liturgical Preparatory Commission that drafted what would become Sacrosanctum Concilium) to begin demolition of the sacred liturgy that was the very foundation Catholic of orthodoxy and orthopraxis.\nTo quote Paul VI, then in the depths of his conciliar delirium at the Council\u2019s close:\nBut one must realize that this council, which exposed itself to human judgment, insisted very much more upon this pleasant side of man, rather than on his unpleasant one.\nIts attitude was very much and deliberately optimistic.\nA wave of affection and admiration flowed from the council over the modern world of humanity\u2026.\nInstead of depressing diagnoses, encouraging remedies; instead of direful prognostics, messages of trust issued from the council to the present-day world.\nThe modern world\u2019s values were not only respected but honored, its efforts approved, its aspirations purified and blessed.\n[emphasis added]\nThus did Paul describe the conciliar \u201copening to the world\u201d through which the world promptly invaded the Church, including large numbers of homosexuals who should never have been admitted to the seminary.\nIn sum, Faggioli is representative of the thinking that requires defense of a homosexualized clergy if only for the reason that tradition-minded Catholics cannot be allowed to take their place: \u201cThis neo-traditionalist Catholicism believes that sexual abuses are committed only by homosexual clergy\u2026 and that the crisis of abuse can be resolved by a kind of Catholic Jacobinism that should eliminate all bishops and priests minimally engaged in dialogue with modern culture, and replaced by a young clergy marked by personal sanctity but also by a fascination for a mythical Middle Ages and the rejection of a Church-world relationship based on a principle of reality.\u201d\nRather than \u201cyoung clergy marked by personal sanctity,\u201d the neo-Catholic mentality Faggioli exemplifies prefers that homosexual priests and bishops be kept in place in order to continue the \u201cdialogue with modern culture.\u201d It is not the integrity of the Faith that matters but only perpetuation of the post-conciliar regime of novelty.\nAny abandonment of the regime must be viewed as ecclesiastical treason\u2014\u201cCatholic Jacobinism\u201d\u2014if not criminal activity.\nFaggioli would probably be more inclined to civil or criminal prosecution of \u201cCatholic Jacobins\u201d for \u201chate speech\u201d than Novus Ordo bishops for their complicity in covering up homosexual rapes.\n\u201cHomosexuality in the clergy exists and is a matter that must be addressed,\u201d Faggioli fleetingly acknowledges toward the end of his piece, \u201cbut the abuse crisis cannot be resolved by making homosexuals within the Church the scapegoat of a scandal that has ancient roots, well before Vatican Council II.\u201d And how does the Church \u201caddress\u201d a massive infestation by homosexual priests and prelates without removing them from authority and ensuring that they cannot promote homosexual successors for generation after generation?\nFaggioli has no answer because what he is really arguing\u2014the final beachhead of the neo-Catholic defense of their disintegrating regime\u2014is that homosexuals in the hierarchy must remain in authority as an indispensable seawall against a \u201cneo-traditionalist\u201d storm surge.\nFaggioli\u2019s argument demonstrates that neo-Catholicism has never been about making the authentic Faith more appealing to a \u201cmodern world\u201d founded precisely on a rejection of the Church\u2019s authority.\nIt is not about the Faith at all.\nRather, it is an ideological movement dedicated to the face-saving defense of a catastrophic failure in ecclesial innovation that has corrupted the human element of the Church in practically every department.\nFor people like Faggioli, indeed for the tradition-hating Pope they blindly defend, the one thing to be feared is that more and more faithful will recognize the neo-Catholic polemic for what it is\u2014a fraud\u2014and begin demanding a return of everything the regime of novelty has stolen from the life of the Church.\nThat is exactly what a growing number of Catholics are now doing, as even the secular press recognized less than three months before Bergoglio began his tyrannical reign.\nIn this respect, what the neo-Catholics are defending at bottom is themselves\u2014that is, the reputations they have all staked on their defense of the indefensible against the traditionalists they have arrogantly mocked and marginalized for decades only to see, to their horror, that traditionalism is ever more vindicated as the scandals of the Novus Ordo mount under this reckless Pope to an unsustainable, indeed apocalyptic, level.\nA return to integral Tradition is the threat that Faggioli sees as coming particularly from the young.\nIrony of ironies, he is now reduced to defending what is old and tired and corrupt against a restoration, led largely by a youthful vanguard, of what is ever ancient but ever new.\nFor some, it seems, no price is too great\u2014not even the good of the Church\u2014to avoid the personal ignominy of being seen on the wrong side of history.\nConclusion: The Fatima Connection\nLong before the arrival of Bergoglio in Rome, the successive Vatican Secretaries of State, Angelo Sodano and Tarcisio Bertone, were instrumental in advancing the homosexual corruption of the Novus Ordo establishment.\nAs to Bertone and Sodano, Vigan\u00f2 provides further vital testimony:\nNuncio Sambi\u2019s report [on McCarrick\u2019s sexual abuse], with all the attachments, was sent to Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, as Secretary of State.\nMy two above-mentioned memos of December 6, 2006 and May 25, 2008, were also presumably handed over to him by the Substitute.\nAs already mentioned, the Cardinal had no difficulty in insistently presenting for the episcopate candidates known to be active homosexuals \u2014 I cite only the well-known case of Vincenzo de Mauro, who was appointed Archbishop-Bishop of Vigevano and later removed because he was undermining his seminarians \u2014 and in filtering and manipulating the information he conveyed to Pope Benedict\u2026.\nCardinal Angelo Sodano was Secretary of State until September 2006: all information [concerning McCarrick] was communicated to him.\nIn November 2000, Nunzio Montalvo sent him his report, passing on to him the aforementioned letter from Father Boniface Ramsey in which he denounced the serious abuses committed by McCarrick.\nIt is known that Sodano tried to cover up the Father Maciel scandal to the end.\nHe even removed the Nuncio in Mexico City, Justo Mullor, who refused to be an accomplice in his scheme to cover Maciel, and in his place appointed Sandri, then-Nuncio to Venezuela, who was willing to collaborate in the cover-up.\nSodano even went so far as to issue a statement to the Vatican press office in which a falsehood was affirmed, that is, that Pope Benedict had decided that the Maciel case should be considered closed.\nBenedict reacted, despite Sodano\u2019s strenuous defense, and Maciel was found guilty and irrevocably condemned.\nIt is no coincidence that, as I detail in my book on the Third Secret of Fatima, Sodano and Bertone have also taken the leading role in suppressing the integral Secret and reducing the Message of Fatima in general to a generic prescription for personal piety, stripped of its prophetic and admonitory content regarding the epochal malfeasance and corruption of the upper hierarchy to which they belong.\nConcerning my book, Archbishop Pietro Sambi, Vigan\u00f2\u2019s predecessor as Nuncio in Washington, whom Vigan\u00f2\u2019 credits with diligently reporting McCarrick\u2019s crimes to the Vatican and conveying Benedict\u2019s sanctions to McCarrick, made some very revealing comments during an interview with Robert Moynihan, published posthumously six years ago in Inside the Vatican:\nWe were discussing the Third Secret of Fatima, the allegations that the Vatican has not published the entire text of the Third Secret as revealed to Sister Lucia, and the response of Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican secretary of state, in a book where Bertone states that there is nothing more to be revealed.\nSambi said, \u201cExcuse me.\u201d He got up, went out of the room, and came back with a book.\n\u201cHere,\u201d he said.\n\u201cDo you know this book?\nYou should read it.\u201d It was Christopher Ferrara's The Secret Still Hidden.\n\u201cWait,\u201d I said.\n\u201cYou are the Pope\u2019s representative in the US, and you are urging me to read a book that questions what the secretary of state wrote?\u201d Sambi replied, \u201cAll I am saying is that there are interesting things worth reading in this book.\nAnd in the end, we are all after the truth, aren\u2019t we?\nThe truth is the important thing...\u201d\nThe truth is indeed the important thing.\nAnd the truth about our situation is revealed in that still-hidden part of the Secret to whose contents Pope Benedict alluded during his pilgrimage to Fatima in 2010, identifying elements that do not appear at all in the obscure vision published back in 2000, which Sodano and Bertone tried to pass of as the entirety of the Secret at the same time they were covering up homosexual corruption in high places:\nAs for the new things which we can find in this message today, there is also the fact that attacks on the Pope and the Church come not only from without, but the sufferings of the Church come precisely from within the Church, from the sin existing within the Church.\nThis too is something that we have always known, but today we are seeing it in a really terrifying way: that the greatest persecution of the Church comes not from her enemies without, but arises from sin within the Church, and that the Church thus has a deep need to relearn penance, to accept purification, to learn forgiveness on the one hand, but also the need for justice.\n[emphasis added]\nI believe that Archbishop Vigan\u00f2\u2019s precious testimony is a sign that Heaven itself is now responding to the \u201cneed for justice\u201d in the Church.\nWhether or not justice involves the resignation of the most wayward Pope in Church history, the inevitable season of justice will culminate in the triumph of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and the Church\u2019s restoration.\nThis will be a final victory over the enemies within and their apologists, such as Faggioli, who, in typical neo-Catholic style, imperiously scoffs at the notion of \u201ca young clergy marked by personal sanctity but also by a fascination for a mythical Middle Ages\u201d and busies himself defending an unsalvageable mass of corruption he dares to describe as \u201ca Church-world relationship based on a principle of reality.\u201d\nI can only conclude by making my own these closing words of Archbishop Vigan\u00f2:\n", ["Repetition", "Thought-terminating_Cliches", "Appeal_to_fear-prejudice",

Devouring Us, HERE.]\nEditors\u2019 note: In light of the skyrocketing phenomenon of Muslim migrants stabbing unbelievers in random stabbing sprees in Europe, as well as the calculated denial that leaders, authorities and media are enforcing about it, Frontpage has deemed it important to bring attention to the crucial steps America and the West must take to robustly confront the unceasing onslaught by Jihad and its leftist enablers.\nWe are, therefore, reprinting below Frontpage editor Jamie Glazov\u2019s July 12, 2016 Breitbart article, \"9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad\".\nHaving written the article in the closing chapter of the disastrous Obama administration, the author recognizes and celebrates the life-saving turn-around disposition that the Trump administration has brought in to counter Jihad.\nFrontpage is most confident that the suggested steps below will continue to be the overall focus of the new administration -- which, thankfully, is now taking many of the crucial and constructive steps vis-\u00e0-vis our enemy.\nWe find the article more relevant and urgent than ever due to the 17th anniversary of 9/11 approaching tomorrow:\n*\n9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad.\nBy Jamie Glazov\nWhile the Obama administration continues to allow the Muslim Brotherhood to direct American foreign policy and, therefore, to implement \u201cstrategies\u201d that render America defenseless in the face of Jihad and stealth Jihad, there are some alternative strategies that have the potential to turn this catastrophic situation around completely in America\u2019s favor.\nBelow are 9 concrete steps that, if implemented by a future American administration, would make a big difference in preserving our civilization and in defending Americans from terrorism:\n1.\nLabel the Enemy and Make a Threat Assessment.\nThe Obama administration continues to refuse to label our enemy and, therefore, it continues to enable our defeat in the terror war.\nIt is urgent that we name our enemy (i.e.\nIslamic Jihad) and definitively identify what ideology inspires our enemy (i.e.\nIslamic law).\n2.\nScrap \u201cCountering Violent Extremism.\u201d\n\u201cCountering Violent Extremism\u201d is the pathetic and destructive focus of the Obama administration in allegedly fighting the terror war.\nOn the one hand, this \u201cfocus\u201d is vague to the point of being meaningless and completely incapacitates us.\nOn the other hand, this focus allows the administration to perpetuate the destructive fantasy that there are other types of \u201cextremists\u201d \u2014 who just happen to be the Left\u2019s political opponents \u2014 that pose a great threat to the country.\nFor example, as Stephen Coughlin has revealed, the \u201cviolent extremists\u201d the administration is clearly worried about are the \u201cright-wing Islamophobes\u201d whom the administration obviously considers to be the real threat to American security.\nThe \u201cCountering Violent Extremism\u201d is trash and needs to be thrown in the garbage.\n3.\nStop \u201cPartnering\u201d With Muslim Brotherhood Front Groups.\nThe government needs to stop cooperating with, and listening to, Muslim Brotherhood front groups such as CAIR and ISNA immediately.\nThe Muslim Brotherhood document, the Explanatory Memorandum, has made it clear that the Brotherhood\u2019s objective is to destroy our civilization from within by our own hands with the influence of these groups.\nMoreover, as Robert Spencer advises, there needs to be legislation that will bar all such groups and affiliated individuals from advising the government or receiving any grants from it.\n4.\nImplement a Concrete \u201cCountering-Jihad\u201d Strategy.\nAfter discarding the \u201cCountering Violent Extremism\u201d absurdity, a concrete Counter-Jihad strategy must become an official policy.\nIt must specifically register that Jihadists are the enemies and that Islamic law (Sharia) is what specifically motivates them.\nMost importantly, as Sebastian Gorka urges in Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War, the government needs to lay down a vision, an actual \u201cthreat doctrine analysis\u201d in a thorough document, just like George Kennan\u2019s Long Telegram and NSC-68 did in laying out the strategic foundation to fighting communism in the Cold War.\nIt is absolutely mind-boggling that nothing of this sort exists today in our terror war \u2014 and it is a reflection of the Left being in charge and of the destructive defeat that it is sowing.\n5.\nLaunch Our Own Counter-propaganda Campaign.\nThe Left and Islamists engage in propaganda 24/7.\nWhat does our propaganda war entail?\nZilch.\nSebastian Gorka is crucially correct, therefore, when he recommends a national counter-propaganda campaign that involves a two-part approach: the first being the bolstering of efforts to define our enemy (Steps #1 and #4 above) and, second, the strengthening of our allies and partners in their own counter-propaganda efforts \u2013 which must include our empowering of Muslims who are trying to form an anti-Jihadist version of Islam.\nConsequently, educational programs have to be set up everywhere, from public schools to universities to workplaces, in businesses and numerous other institutions.\nThese programs must crystallize what exactly Islamic Law is and how it inspires and sanctions violence against unbelievers.\nThis has to also involve, as Gorka urges, \u201ca nationwide program of education that includes the armed services as well as federal, state, and local police forces and the intelligence community.\u201d\nThe education campaign must also focus on the second part of Gorka\u2019s counter-propaganda campaign, which is to help strengthen Muslims who seek to seize Islam from the jihadists\u2019 hands.\n6.\nAffirm Sharia\u2019s Assault on the U.S. Constitution as Seditious.\nOnce the truth is accepted that jihadis are inspired and sanctioned by their Islamic texts, it must logically become required that mosques, Islamic schools and groups have to immediately curtail any teaching that motivates sedition, violence, and hatred of unbelievers (i.e.\nremember how CAIR advised Muslims not to talk to the FBI).\nIndeed, once the government discerns and labels the elements of Islamic law that threaten the American Constitution, any preaching and spreading of those elements in America must be labelled as seditious.\n7.\nPut Pressure on Mosques, Islamic Groups and Schools.\nAuthorities have to start subjecting mosques and other Islamic institutions to surveillance \u2014 and discard the suicidal leftist notion that it is \u201cracist\u201d and Islamophobic to do so.\nIslamic institutions have to be made to buffer their lip-service against terror with actually doing something about it.\nAs Robert Spencer counsels, this has to involve introducing programs that teach against jihadists\u2019 understanding of Islam \u2014 and these programs have to be regularly monitored by the government.\n(This will be a part of Gorka\u2019s suggested counter-propaganda campaign discussed in Step #5).\nSpencer rightly stresses that the paradigm has to become that Muslim communities have to win the \u201ctrust\u201d of intelligence and law enforcement agents, rather than the other way around, which is, absurdly and tragically, the case right now.\n8.\nBring Counter-Jihadists into the Government.\nInstead of having Muslim Brotherhood sympathizers like Mohamed Elibiary serving on the U.S.\nHomeland Security Advisory Council (he \u201cresigned\u201d in Sept. 2014 under mysterious circumstances), and Muslim Brotherhood-linked individuals like Huma Abedin serving as the right-hand woman of Hillary Clinton, we need to bring in people who actually love America and want to protect it.\nWe all know who these noble and courageous individuals are \u2013 and some of them are referenced in this article.\nThe government must also bring in brave Muslim individuals who genuinely reject Jihad and empower them in propagating their anti-jihadist vision for Islam.\n(P.S.\nYes, there is an argument to be made that Islam cannot be Islam without Jihad.\nBut the debate over this belongs in another forum.\nAnd whatever the answer, it does not mean that the effort to empower Muslims who want to make the anti-jihadist Islamic vision possible should not be made.)\n9.\nRidicule the Enemy.\nRidicule is a vicious and potent weapon.\nThere is a baffling and shameful silence in our culture\u2019s sphere of comedy, especially in Hollywood and our media, with regard to the myriad ingredients of Sharia and Jihad that merit at least a million hilarious satirical sketches.\nBill Maher, for whatever unappealing drawbacks he has in conservatives\u2019 eyes, has set a bold standard in this respect in his Burka Fashion Show skit.\nAmerican comedians need to start writing scripts that follow in Maher\u2019s footsteps and Americans need to encourage and equip them to do so \u2013 and to also vigorously defend them from the attacks and slanders they will inevitably receive from totalitarian leftist and Islamic forces.\nWe must never underestimate the crippling effect of comedy on the totalitarian Mullahs of the world.\nIndeed, the contemptuous, snickering and roaring laughter of people, as they gaze at the pathetic rules and lives of Sharia\u2019s gatekeepers, poses a danger to tyrants like no other.\nJamie Glazov holds a Ph.D. in History

proof of real \u201ccollusion\u201d between Google and the Hillary Clinton campaign has been uncovered.\nAnd Google likely violated federal election laws \u2014 not to mention the privacy of its users \u2014 in the services it provided the Clinton campaign.\nFox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson read an internal email on Monday night\u2019s show that outlined in a Google\u2019 executive\u2019s own words how the company was providing a \u201csilent donation\u201d to a group that was creating ads and donating funds to bus Latinos to voting stations in key swing states.\nThe email was sent by Eliana Murillo, the former head of Google\u2019s multicultural marketing department.\nThe email was forwarded to Google vice presidents and other staff members throughout the company, Carlson said.\nAccording to Carlson:\nIn her email, Mario touts Google\u2019s multi-faceted efforts to boost Hispanic turnout in the election.\nShe noticed that Latino voters did record-breaking numbers, especially in states like Florida, Nevada and Arizona \u2014 the last of which she describes as \u201ca key state for us.\u201d She brags that the company used its power to ensure that millions of

did.\u201d\nThe assistance Google provided to the Clinton campaign likely violated election laws and served as an unreported in-kind contribution.\nOf course, anyone who paid attention was aware of Google\u2019s attempts to interfere on Clinton\u2019s behalf.\nWikiLeaks\u2019 Julian Assange revealed two years ago that Google CEO Eric Schmidt and a number of Google employees created a company in 2015 specifically to place Clinton the White House.\nEmails obtained by WikiLeaks showed correspondence between Schmidt and Clinton, along with a number of Clinton operatives discussing strategy meetings and campaign ideas.\nAmong the strategies was the creation of a voter tracking database using smart phones.\nA report by a research team earlier this year found that Google can manipulate opinions of undecided voters by inserting negative search suggestions under the name of a candidate.\nMeanwhile, Trump took to Twitter early Tuesday morning to note the Department of Justice\u2019s inaction over the fact that disgraced anti-Trump FBI agent Peter Strzok and his mistress were engaged in a \u201cmedia leak strategy\u201d to plant negative stories which were then used to secure FISA

areas they care about (\u201cthe benefits of ACA to you\u201d etc.)\nAs a reminder, in late October of 2016 it was revealed that just days prior to the April 15, 2014 email, Schmidt had sent another email in which he expressed his eagerness to \u201cfund\u201d the campaign efforts and wants to be a \u201chead outside advisor.\u201d In the email from John Podesta to Robby Mook we learned that:\nI met with Eric Schmidt tonight.\nAs David reported, he\u2019s ready to fund, advise recruit talent, etc.\nHe was more deferential on structure than I expected.\nWasn\u2019t pushing to run through one of his existing firms.\nClearly wants to be head outside advisor, but didn\u2019t seem like he wanted to push others out.\nClearly wants to get going.\nHe\u2019s still in DC tomorrow and would like to meet with you if you are in DC in the afternoon.\nI think it\u2019s worth doing.\nYou around?\nIf you are, and want to meet with him, maybe the four of us can get on t\nAnother email from February 2015 suggested that the Google Chairman remained active in its collaboration with the Clinton campaign: John Podesta wrote that Eric Schmidt met with HR \u201cabout the business he proposes to do with the campaign.\nHe says he\u2019s met with HRC\u201d and adds that \u201cFYI.\nThey are donating the Google plane for the Africa trip\u201d\nMeanwhile, according to a Breitbart report by Allum Bokhari, \u201cBy inserting negative search suggestions under the name of a candidate, search engines like Google can shift the opinions of undecided voters by up to 43.4 percent, according to new research by a team at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology and reported exclusively by Breitbart News.\u201d\nThe lead author of the study, Dr. Robert Epstein, has previously conducted research into what he calls the Search Engine Manipulation Effect (SEME).\nThis research showed that the manipulation of results pages in search engines can shift the voting preferences of undecideds by anywhere between 20 and 80 percent, depending on the demographic.\nHis latest research looks at how search engines can affect voters by suggesting negative or positive search terms when a political candidate\u2019s name is entered into the search bar.\nDr. Epstein\u2019s research found that when negative search terms are suggested for a candidate, it can have a dramatic effect on voter opinion.\n\u2013Breitbart\nSo, despite Google\u2019s best efforts to help Clinton win the election, it simply wasn\u2019t enough.\nMeanwhile, Google has yet to answer why their search results for the

Clinton\nGoogle, once again, has been implicated in a story about how social media executives and employees are using their platforms to control and shutter conservative ideas.\nThis time?\nThis time, an email chain has emerged showing senior company executives pressing for the company to sway Latino voters to back Hillary Clinton.\ntake our poll - story continues below\nCompleting this poll grants

rides of Latinos to get them to the polls \u2014 if they vote for Clinton, that is.\nFirst censorship, now this.\nWhen will something be done about these tech and social media companies?\nFrom Breitbart:\nAn email chain among senior Google executives from the day after the 2016 presidential election reveals the company tried to influence the 2016 United States presidential election on behalf of one candidate, Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton.\nIn the emails, a Google executive describes efforts to pay for free rides for a certain sect of the population to the polls\u2013a get-out-the-vote for Hispanic voters operation\u2013and how these efforts were because she thought it would help Hillary Clinton win the general election in 2016.\nShe also used the term \u201csilent donation\u201d to describe Google\u2019s contribution to the effort to elect Clinton president.\nThe main email, headlined, \u201cElection results and the Latino vote,\u201d was sent on Nov. 9, 2016\u2014the day after Clinton\u2019s loss to Trump in the 2016 presidential election\u2014by Eliana Murillo, Google\u2019s Multicultural Marketing department head.\nThe four page email begins with Murillo claiming she and others at Google were engaged in non-partisan activities not designed to help any one candidate or another\u2014only to undercut her own commentary in later passages in the emails by openly admitting the entire effort to boost Latino turnout using Google products with official company resources was to elect Clinton over Trump.\nThe critical miscalculation, Murillo wrote in a stunning admission in the email, was that Latino voters backed Trump by higher margins than any experts had forecast in the lead-up to the election.\nTrump\u2019s 29 percent among Hispanics nationally blew prognosticators away, and he hit even higher numbers\u2014about 31 percent\u2014in the key battleground state of Florida, Murillo admitted.\nMurillo wrote at the outset of the lengthy message:\nWe worked very hard.\nMany people did.\nWe pushed tp get out the Latino vote with our features, our partners, and our voices.\nWe kept our Google efforts non-partisan and followed our company\u2019s protocols for the elections strategy.\nWe emphasized our mission to give Latinos access to information so that they can make an informed decision at the polls, and we feel very grateful for all the support to do this important work.\nLatinos voted in record-breaking numbers, particularly with early votes.\nA large percentage of Latino voters in Florida were new voters who had become citizens just in time to vote.\nWe saw high traffic for the search queries \u2018votar,\u2019 \u2018como votar,\u2019 and \u2018donde voter,\u2019 in key states like Florida and Nevada.\nWe will be pulling in more info in the coming hours/days but so far we definitely know there was high traffic on search in Spanish.\nWithout translating our tools the users wouldn\u2019t have found the information they needed.\nObjectively speaking, our goal was met \u2014 we pushed and successfully launched the search features in Spanish, and we thank Lisa for her support in advocating for this work.\nI sent Philipp a note yesterday to thank him because he and others voiced their support for this too, and we greatly appreciate it.\nEven Sundar gave the effort a shout out and a comment in Spanish, which was really special.\n\u201cSundar\u201d presumably refers to Google\u2019s chief executive officer Sundar Pichai, who took the reins of the massive search giant in October 2015.\n\u201cLisa\u201d presumably refers to Lisa Gevelber, the vice president of Global Marketing for Google\u2014who forwarded Murillo\u2019s entire four-page email to several other Google executives in another chain also obtained by Breitbart News in which Gevelber praises Murillo\u2019s activities with official company resources as having made a \u201cgreat difference.\u201d \u201cPhilipp\u201d presumably refers to Philipp Schindler, a senior vice president and Google\u2019s chief business officer per his LinkedIn page.\nThe emails were first revealed on Fox News on Monday evening on Tucker Carlson Tonight by anchor Tucker Carlson in a special report.\nBreitbart News also obtained them, and has reached out to Google with a number of questions about the emails.\nCarlson, in his exclusive report on Fox News Monday night, compared the revelations in the Google emails to the probe of Russian interference in the U.S. election to Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2014raising the question about how much influence tech giants like Google and Facebook have on election outcomes in the United States.\nCarlson cited Dr. Robert Epstein, a social scientist and an expert on Google, who has said, in Carlson\u2019s words, \u201cGoogle alone could determine the outcome of almost any election just by altering its search selections and we would never know it.\u201d\nEpstein has published research detailing how Google could influence the results of U.S. elections.\nBreitbart News has exclusively published several of Epstein\u2019s reports, including a recent one showing that Google search manipulation can swing huge swaths of voters.\nIn his report on Monday night, Carlson then described the emails he obtained, which Breitbart News also obtained.\nCarlson said:\nThis wasn\u2019t a get-out-the-vote effort or whatever they say.\nIt wasn\u2019t aimed at all potential voters.\nIt wasn\u2019t even aimed at a balanced cross-section of subgroups.\nGoogle didn\u2019t try to get out the vote among say Christian Arabs in Michigan or say Persian Jews in Los Angeles\u2014they sometimes vote Republican.\nIt was aimed only at one group, a group that Google cynically assumed would vote exclusively for the Democratic Party.\nFurthermore, this mobilization effort targeted not only the entire country but swing states vital to the Hillary campaign.\nThis was not an exercise in civics, this was political consulting.\nIt was in effect an in-kind contribution to the Hillary Clinton campaign.\u201d\nCarlson noted that in communication with Google, the company \u201cdid not deny that the email was real or that it showed a clear political preference.\u201d\n\u201cTheir only defense was that the activities they described were either non-partisan or were not officially taken by the company,\u201d Carlson said Monday night, describing Google\u2019s official response to his requests for comment, before challenging the company\u2019s response: \u201cBut of course they were both.\nPlenty of people in Google knew what was going on and we haven\u2019t seen any evidence anyone at Google disapproved of it and tried to rein it in.\u201d\nThe email from Murillo continues by explaining just how expansive the efforts the company undertook to achieve its objective were:\nWe had our partners help spread the word about our features on social media, including YouTubers and influencers like Dulce Candy, Jorge Narvaez, Jessie y Joy, Barbara Bermudo, and Pamela Silva of Univision, Jackie Cruz aka La Flaca from Orange is the New Black, and more.\nWe promoted our partner the Latino Community Foundation\u2019s non-partisan #YoVoyaVotaryTu (I\u2019m going to vote, are you?)\ncampaign and leveraged our social media influencer friends\u2019 reach to hit over 11M impressions with that hashtag.\nWe hosted an event with over 200 people and a hangout with social media influencers about the power of the Latino vote and the new research Nielsen published about the Latino electorate.\nThis reached 4.4M social media impressions and signaled to many that Google and our partners value the Latino community and our role in this election.\nWe brought the same research to the LATISM conference, where people were beyond thrilled to see Google\u2019s support and acknowledgment of the Latino community.\nIf Murillo had ended her email there, this probably would not amount to the level of a national news story.\nBut she did not: She went on for another several paragraphs on the first page and an extra three pages to admit the openly partisan intent of Google\u2019s actions, including a remarkable in-writing confirmation that at least one of Google\u2019s actions amounted to a \u201csilent donation\u201d\u2014something that could raise Federal Election Commission (FEC) red flags if authorities decide to launch an official investigation into this matter, now that these emails have been publicly revealed.\nIt is in the next paragraph that Murillo openly admits that Google made a \u201csilent donation,\u201d in her words, paying for rides to polls via leftist organization Voto Latino.\nMurillo wrote in the next paragraph:\nWe also supported partners like Voto Latino to pay for rides to the polls in key states (silent donation).\nWe even helped them create ad campaigns to promote the rides (with support from HOLA folks who rallied and volunteered their time to help).\nWe supported Voto Latino to help them land an interview with Senator Meza of Arizona (key state for us) to talk about the election and how to use Google search to find information about how to vote.\nThey were a strong partner, among many in this effort.\nThe next paragraph is where Murillo begins to make her next major admission: that the effort was not just to increase voter turnout generally but to elect Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump.\n\u201cUltimately, after all was said and done, the Latino community did come out to vote, and completely surprised us,\u201d Murillo wrote.\n\u201cWe never anticipated that 29% of Latinos would vote for Trump.\nNo one did.\nWe saw headlines like this about early voter turn out and thought that this was finally the year that the \u2018sleeping giant\u2019 had awoken.\u201d\nOn the next page, the email continues with a headline from an article in The Atlantic by James Fallows: \u201c2016: The Year Latinos Saved America?\u201d\nUnder that was a tweet from Jon Ralston of Ralston Reports in Nevada saying, among other things, that \u201cTrump is dead\u201d because of Latino turnout in early voting in the state.\nTrump did not end up winning Nevada in the end, but he did beat Clinton in 30 and a half other states.\n\u2026\nAt that point, after the Ralston tweet, Murillo openly admits the partisan motives of Google\u2019s electioneering efforts.\n\u201cOn personal note, we really thought we had shown up to demonstrate our political power against a candidate who had vehemently offended our community by calling us rapists and drug dealers,\u201d Murillo wrote.\n\u201cWe read the headline and thought WOW, we did it!\u201d\nMurillo\u2019s email continues by including another headline, this time from the New Yorker\u2019s Benjamin Wallace-Wells: \u201cLatino Voters Show Trump What It Means to Be American.\u201d That piece was written on Nov. 7, 2016, the day before the election.\nThen she begins writing again: \u201cBut then reality set in.\nOnly 71% of Latinos voted for Hillary, and that wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d\nThe third page of the email begins with another headline and image of a Latina woman in a red Make America Great Again hat and \u201cLatinos for Trump\u201d sign.\nThe story, from Ruben Navarette, Jr., published in the Daily Beast, is headlined: \u201cWhy the Latino Vote Didn\u2019t Save America.\u201d The sub-headline, \u201cHispanic voters were supposed to be one of Clinton\u2019s blue firewalls\u2014but one in three ended up splitting for Trump,\u201d is also included in Murillo\u2019s Google email.\nFrom there, Murillo continues writing for another page and a half:\nThe voters we wanted to reach did end up having an influence in the end, most notably in Florida.\nLatino voters voted for Trump more in Florida than in other states (31%), and FL was critical by popular vote and the electoral college.\nWe\u2019ll keep an eye on any other results that can show us the influence that our efforts had on the election.\nWe know we gave this our best and are now figuring out what comes next.\nThanks again for all your help and support in this effort.\nIn the next paragraph, Murillo again openly admits she was not \u201cobjective\u201d when it came to the election.\n\u201cI have tried to stay objective, but I ask that you please give us some time to pause and reflect,\u201d Murillo wrote.\n\u201cThis is devastating for our Democratic Latino community.\nAfter all these efforts and what we thought was positive momentum toward change, the results are not what we expected at all.\nWe are afraid for our families, and especially for the millions of immigrants who now don\u2019t know what the future holds for them.\u201d\nAfter that, Murillo says she cannot communicate with key organizers of the effort by Google and its partners\u2014a project known as HOLA\u2014because she is afraid of secret pro-Trump spies on the listservs created.\nShe also admits ongoing discussions among these people about meeting to give grieving Hillary Clinton supporters hugs after Trump crushed her on election day.\nShe also says those involved in Google\u2019s get-out-the-vote efforts were openly seeking consolation after Clinton lost, and that she and another person cried after Trump won \u2013 for the first time they have cried due to an election result.\nMurillo wrote:\nWhat\u2019s most difficult for us is we can\u2019t even email the HOLA list to reach our community and discuss what this means for us because we know that apparently some may actually be Trump supporters.\nThere is a thread right now among the core HOLA group where people are sharing how much they hurt, how much they need support right now, and that they are coordinating in different offices to meet up to just hold each other.\nOne in a remote office said \u2018If you guys do any sort of meetings, I\u2019d love to join virtually.\nI think I\u2019m currently the only Latinx in my office.\nIt\u2019s kinda hard.\u2019 #understatement.\nAnother said, \u2018I\u2019ve never cried after an election until last night.\u2019 Same here.\nShe was not done there.\nIn the next paragraph, Murillo wrote that this election result hurt her badly.\nShe also admits the election result was a \u201closs,\u201d another indication that Google\u2019s efforts were clearly attempting to use company resources to elect Democrat Clinton over Republican Trump and influence the results of the election.\nShe also says that the company\u2014and herself in particular\u2014will redouble efforts in the future to get a different and more desired result in future elections.\n\u201cI\u2019m in shock and it hurts more than I could have ever imagined, but trying to stay optimistic and keep my head high,\u201d Murillo wrote.\n\u201cLoss is a part of life, and I do think frustrations challenge us to work smarter and get creative.\nMy partners have sent notes and are saying the same thing \u2014 time to keep working harder.\u201d\nAt the top of the fourth page of the email, Murillo asks her colleagues at Google to give out a \u201csmile\u201d to grieving leftist Latinos who work at the company.\n\u201cIf you see a Latino Googler in the office (California/New York), please give them a smile,\u201d Murillo wrote.\n\u201cThey are probably hurting right now.\nIt\u2019s tough to handle now that we know not all of us were against this, so we may be even more divided than ever.\nAt least in CA/NY though, you can rest assured that the Latinos of these blue states need your thoughts and prayers, at least for them and their families.\u201d\nThen, she continues by stating she is going on a planned vacation she thought she was taking to \u201ccelebrate\u201d a Clinton win, but after Trump won, she says, her vacation \u201cwill be time to reflect on how to continue to support my community through these difficult times.\u201d\nMurillo, in the next line, reveals that she thought she was sharing her viewpoints on these matters in a tight circle that would not leak.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sharing my personal opinions very broadly, but wanted to share openly here in the circle of trust,\u201d she wrote.\nThis email leaked to Fox News and Breitbart News and is now likely to become a centerpiece in the case that Google is throwing its weight around to interfere in elections in the United States in a partisan manner against the duly elected President of the United States.\nThis email from Murillo was not just from some rogue staffer inside Google.\nHer original email was forwarded on to other Google executives by the aforementioned Gevelber, according to another email obtained by Breitbart News.\n\u201cThought you all would want to read this,\u201d Gevelber wrote in her own message endorsing Murillo\u2019s email in a message to other Google bigwigs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s from Eliana Murillo who runs US Hispanic Marketing on my team and who helped found HOLA our Hispanic ERC.\u201d\nGevelber continued by commending everyone she said, \u201cworked so hard to ensure all the Get out the Vote were done in Spanish\u201d that their efforts \u201cmade a giant difference\u201d in the election \u201cto Googlers and beyond.\u201d\nPresident Trump and Republicans have just begun scratching the surface of bias against them among Silicon Valley\u2019s elite, including, perhaps foremost alongside Facebook, from Google.\nA source close to the White House who has reviewed these emails ahead of their public release told Breitbart News that in a just world this would amount to, at a minimum, a clear violation of campaign finance law governing in-kind contributions to campaigns and causes.\n\u2026\n", ["Repetition", "Flag-Waving", "Doubt", "Exaggeration,Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Causal_Oversimplification", "Name_Calling,Labeling", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Slogans"]],

plantation -- on which many in the West are now enslaved and dutifully following his orders.\nJamie outlines the frameworks of this tyrannical plantation and how those who are trapped on it, and yearn for freedom, can best escape.]\nReprinted from WND.com.\nSomewhere in the \u201ccommunity standards\u201d that Facebook demands everyone follow is a real doozy.\nThe social-media company has told author and commentator Jamie Glazov that their standards forbid his article about how to prevent jihadi attacks on Americans.\nIt\u2019s all about Glazov\u2019s new book, \u201cJihadist Psychopath: How He Is Charming, Seducing, and Devouring Us.\u201d\nAt FrontPage Magazine, where he is editor, he had posted \u201c9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad,\u201d which included recommendations such as \u201cLabel the enemy and make a threat assessment\u201d and \u201cStop \u2018partnering\u2019 with Muslim Brotherhood front groups.\u201d\nThat apparently was too much for Facebook, which declared \u201conly you can see this post\u201d because it \u201cgoes against our Community Standards.\u201d\nHe was suspended from Facebook for 30 days on Sept. 11, the anniversary of the Islamic jihadist attack on America that killed nearly 3,000.\nGlazov told Breitbart, \u201cThis is really getting surreal in the creepiest and most harrowing Stalinist sense.\u201d\nFrontPage Magazine reported:\nFacebook\u2019s Unholy Alliance masters are, without doubt, accelerating their totalitarian suffocation of free thought and expression.\nIt is no surprise, therefore, that Frontpage\u2019s editor, and host of \u2018The Glazov Gang,\u2019 was suspended from Facebook for 30 days yesterday, on September 11, after posting his article, \u20189 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad.\u2019 Glazov believed that the article was more relevant and urgent than ever due to the skyrocketing jihadist stabbings in Europe \u2014 and to the 17th anniversary of 9/11 that was approaching the next day.\nThe report said it appears \u201cthat daring to give suggestions on how our civilization can stop jihadist attacks and another 9/11 is against Facebook\u2019s \u2018community standards.\n'\u201d\n\u201cGlazov\u2019s advice also involves the promotion of supporting moderate Muslims \u2013 a move that is, clearly, horrifying to Facebook\u2019s masters and therefore also violates their \u2018community standards,'\u201d the report said.\nNo doubt, Glazov\u2019s consistent campaigning on behalf of Muslim women and girls in his efforts to protect them from FGM, honor killings and other Shariah barbarities, has gained him the anger and hatred of Facebook\u2019s guardians \u2014 who are clearly on the side of the Shariah enforcers and oppressors of Muslim women and girls.\nThe report recalls that Facebook censored Glazov in April for posting screenshots of a Muslim\u2019s threat to him.\nTwitter also lashed out at him for quoting directly from Islamic religious texts, citing its anti-\u201chate\u201d policies.\nIt is \u2018hateful conduct,\u2019 apparently, to reference what Islamic texts themselves say.\nIndeed, Frontpage\u2019s editor had simply referred to Sahih Bukhari\u2019s texts discussing Mohammed\u2019s marriage to Aisha when she was six years old (7.62.88) and to Quranic Suras that mandate the Hijab for women (24:31; 33:59) and sanction sexual slavery (4:3; 33:50).\nFacebook also refused to respond to Glazov\u2019s inquiry about \u201cwhat it is specifically that violates Facebook\u2019s \u2018community standards\u2019 when a person gives advice on how to best defend American lives from jihad.\u201d\nGlazov has written about the subject in previous books, including \u201cHigh Noon for America: The Coming Showdown\u201d and \u201cUnited in Hate.\u201d\nIn his \u201c9 Steps\u201d article, he points out that the Obama administration was \u201ccooperating with, and listening to, Muslim Brotherhood front groups such as CAIR and

He Is Charming, Seducing, and Devouring Us: HERE.\nThe book illustrates how the Jihadist Psychopath has, with the help of the Left, successfully built his totalitarian plantation in the West -- on which the political and cultural establishment is now enslaved and dutifully following his orders.\nJamie outlines the frameworks of this tyrannical plantation and how those who are trapped on it, and yearn for freedom, can best escape.]\nFrontpage editors are happy to announce our free speech victory: Facebook has lifted Frontpage editor Jamie Glazov's 30-day ban on Facebook, apologizing and saying that the block was a \u201cmistake\u201d.\nWe have no doubt, of course, that no \u201cmistake\u201d had actually occurred in this matter and that the ban has only been lifted because of the publicity that we engaged in -- and received.\nWhile it is a positive development that Facebook has lifted the ban on Jamie (for now), this story is crucial to amplify now more than ever, seeing that Facebook, and all of leftist-run social media, is, at this moment, clearly accelerating its totalitarian attack on the free speech of conservatives.\n(See Jamie's video on this whole surreal affair HERE).\nA brief recap of Jamie's story: on Sept. 11, the 17th Anniversary of the 9/11 terror strike, Facebook's Unholy Alliance masters informed Jamie that he was suspended from Facebook for 30 days due to his posting of his article, 9 Steps to Successfully Counter Jihad, which Facebook informed him violated their \"community standards.\"\nThis suggested, of course, that giving advice on how to prevent another 9/11, and all other Jihadist attacks against America, is now against Facebook\u2019s \u2018community standards\u2019.\n(Read the whole story HERE.)\nFrontpage and Jamie immediately publicized this tyrannical behavior of Facebook.\nThen, yesterday, on Sept. 13, Facebook notified Jamie that it had made a mistake and that it was lifting his block.\nIt goes without saying that this retraction and surrender by Facebook occurred only because of the wide publicity that Jamie's banning had received.\nAnd we are immensely grateful for all the massive support that was given to us across the Internet, including especially from Breitbart, PJMedia, WorldNetDaily and Thomas Lifson at American Thinker.\nLeading brave conservative figures such as Michelle Malkin and Laura Loomer also stood up for Jamie, tweeting about his ban -- and to them we send our heartfelt appreciation.\nJamie is, of course, no stranger to social media censorship -- especially of the insane variety.\nThe Counter Jihad Coalition's (CJC) Facebook page, which Jamie helped run with CJC President Steve Amundson, was removed a few years ago with absolutely no explanation.\nThe CJC is a human rights and pro-national security group that is dedicated to protecting America and the West from Jihad -- and Muslim and non-Muslim people from Sharia oppression.\nThe question remains: why would Facebook remove such a page, let alone in such a fascistic manner -- and never explain why?\nIn April earlier this year, Jamie was suspended from Facebook for posting screenshots of a Muslim's threat to him on the platform.\nThen, in May, his Twitter account was temporarily suspended and he was forced to delete tweets he posted which directly quoted Islamic religious texts.\nHis account was suspended for violating Twitter\u2019s rules relating to \u201chateful conduct.\u201d It is \"hateful conduct\", apparently, to reference what Islamic texts themselves say.\nIndeed, Frontpage's editor had simply referred to Sahih Bukhari\u2019s texts discussing Mohammed\u2019s marriage to Aisha when she was six years old (7.62.88) and to Qur'anic Suras that mandate the Hijab for women (24:31; 33:59) and sanction sexual slavery (4:3; 33:50).\nOne thing we know for sure is that, despite this lifting of Jamie\u2019s ban, Facebook and the leftist totalitarians in other social media venues and in the culture at large will continue their unrelenting effort to suffocate dissent and conservative voices.\nOn Facebook, many brave conservative truth-tellers continue to be censored in myriad ways; these individuals include Anni Cyrus, Bosch Fawstin, Mark Lutchman and, of course, Diamond & Silk.\nThe case of #WalkAway leader Brandon Straka is especially disturbing: he was recently banned by Facebook for the crime of announcing that he would be interviewed by Alex Jones.\nPrager U has had its videos mysteriously disappear off of Facebook and then, only after vociferous protest, re-appear.\nFacebook is, of course, just one terrain of this leftist brownshirt-style assault on free speech.\nEveryone knows by now, for instance, what has happened, in the most Orwellian sense, to Alex Jones and InfoWars on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.\nLeading scholar of Islam and JihadWatch.org Director Robert Spencer, meanwhile, is not just a target at Facebook, where his referrals are down 90% from what they once were; he has been banned by Patreon at the behest of MasterCard -- and MasterCard has yet to respond to his lawyer\u2019s letter.\nGoFundMe has also banned Spencer because of a smear by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) hate machine.\nSpeaking of Mastercard, the David Horowitz Freedom Center just recently won a major battle with the credit card, defeating well-financed leftwing groups that are trying to run the Center out of business and suffocate free speech in America.\nThe Freedom Center emerged victorious, but it is clear that leftist hate groups such as the SPLC and Color of Change.org are preparing new attacks against the Freedom Center and other conservative groups and individuals 24/7.\nTo be sure, the Left's attacks on the David Horowitz Freedom Center continue unabated: just recently a hit piece in the Washington Post smeared a stand-up noble gentleman like Florida Gubernatorial Candidate Republican Ron DeSantis, libeling David Horowitz in the process.\nThe article stated falsely and maliciously that Horowitz's Restoration Weekend, that DeSantis had attended, was somehow \u201ca racially charged event\u201d -- a vicious lie that Frontpage has exposed and for which the Washington Post is still to apologize and issue a retraction.\n(To learn why David Horowitz is one of the central targets of the Left, make sure to watch this video).\nThus, we clearly gauge that there is no disgusting and venomous level to which the Left will not stoop in its destructive agenda.\nYes, Frontpage editor Jamie Glazov has had his ban lifted at Facebook, but this is clearly only a brief reprieve for him on that platform -- and it is only, obviously, a very tiny space in the Stalinist Left's war on America and on everything on which it stands.\nAt this dire moment, we all need to amplify our voices in defense of free speech.\nAnd we need to adamantly defend all the truth-tellers at the very moment they come under attack.\nWe also need to contact our representatives and to call for a Congressional investigation into this pernicious assault by the fascist Left on our liberties.\nThe battle for America -- and for the West -- is on.\n[Editors' postscript: Please make sure to FOLLOW Jamie Glazov on Facebook as well as on Twitter (@JamieGlazov) to strengthen his social media strength in the face of the Left's vicious war on

New York Daily News, Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, held a woman down, covered her mouth and tried to force himself on her while drunk at a party in high school.\nThat\u2019s the nexus of a letter allegedly acquired by Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein in July but dropped on the last days before the vote for Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation.\nThe unidentified woman says the incident took place at a party in the early 1980s while Kavanaugh was a student at Georgetown Preparatory School in Bethesda, Md., according to the NYDN, which claims to have obtained the letter on Friday.\nShe alleges Kavanaugh and a friend of his, both of whom had been drinking, cornered her in a room and turned up the music to blur out the sound of her protests.\nKavanaugh then allegedly covered the woman\u2019s mouth with his hand and attempted to force himself on her, but she says she managed to free herself and bolt out of the room.\nKavanaugh, 53, vehemently denied the woman\u2019s allegations.\n\u201cI categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\u201cI did not do this back in high school or at any time.\u201d\nKavanaugh\u2019s friend, who has not been identified, did not outright deny the woman\u2019s claims but told the New Yorker he has \u201cno recollection of that.\u201d\nThe woman says she has had to undergo psychological treatment as a result of the incident.\nShe first approached her congresswoman, Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., about the allegations in July shortly after Trump tapped Kavanaugh to replace outgoing Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy.\nEshoo\u2019s office declined to comment.\nThe woman\u2019s letter was in turn forwarded to Feinstein, D-Calif., who shared it with the FBI and her Democratic committee colleagues on Wednesday night.\nAn FBI official told the New York Daily News on Thursday that the letter has not yet resulted in a criminal investigation.\nAccording to Breitbart, on Friday, 65 women from both the Republican and Democrat parties who have known Kavanaugh since high school defended his character and said he has always behaved \u201chonorably\u201d and treaded \u201cwomen with respect.\u201d\nThe women also said that Kavanaugh has \u201cstood out for his friendship, character, and integrity.\u201d\n\u201cJudge

vouching for his integrity and respect for women over that time,\u201d says Carrie Severino, chief counsel for the Judicial Crisis Network.\n\u201cThis is nothing more than a last-minute attempt at character assassination, and there should no delay in confirming Judge Kavanaugh.\u201d\n", ["Loaded_Language", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Slogans"]], ["The Last-Minute Character Assassination of Judge Kavanaugh\nUsing any despicable tactic at hand to derail Judge Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation less than a week before the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on whether to approve his nomination, Senate Democrats have sunk to their lowest level of character assassination yet.\nThey have resorted to peddling an allegation of sexual misconduct against Judge Kavanaugh that supposedly occurred while the judge was in high school.\nThe accuser had refused to identify herself before and during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings.\nShe conveniently waited until this Sunday to come forward via an on-the-record interview with the Washington Post.\nThe accuser\u2019s name is Christine Blasey Ford, a registered Democrat who is currently a California professor teaching clinical psychology.\nJudge Kavanaugh issued a statement on Friday in which he said, \"I categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation.\nI did not do this back in high school or at any time.\"\nSenator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee that heard Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s public testimony earlier this month during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing, had received last July a copy of a letter written by the woman making the charge, who we now know was Ms. Ford.\nEven though Senator Feinstein had the letter in hand, she never brought up the charge during the public hearing, nor during her own meeting with the judge.\nInstead, Senator Feinstein sat on the letter until late last week, when she issued a cryptic release stating that she had received the letter but did not want to give more details in deference to the woman\u2019s wish to keep the matter confidential.\nSenator Feinstein turned the letter over to the FBI.\nThe FBI placed the letter in its background file on Judge Kavanaugh but decided not to pursue any further investigation.\nSenator Feinstein had initially resisted sharing the contents of the letter with her fellow Democrat members of the Senate Judiciary Committee or to go public with its existence because \u201cthe incident was too distant in the past to merit public discussion\u201d and she had already \u201ctaken care of it,\u201d according to a source quoted by The New Yorker.\nNevertheless, Senator Feinstein evidently bowed to pressure from her leftist colleagues to find a way to insert the allegation into the cesspool of public gossip at the eleventh hour.\nThe New Yorker article, written before Ms. Ford publicly identified herself, provided some details regarding her allegation.\nHowever, now Ms. Ford has decided to do what she called her \u201ccivic responsibility\u201d and tell her own story publicly.\nHow convenient, coming just 4 days before the scheduled Senate Judiciary Committee vote!\nThe whole sequence of events surrounding how this allegation has suddenly come to light reeks of a set-up, reminiscent of how Anita Hill surfaced in a last-minute attempt to derail Justice Clarence Thomas's Supreme Court confirmation.\nChristine Blasey Ford claims, according to the Washington Post article, that \u201cone summer in the early 1980s, Kavanaugh and a friend \u2014 both \u2018stumbling drunk,\u2019 Ford alleges \u2014 corralled her into a bedroom during a gathering of teenagers at a house in Montgomery County.\nWhile his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it.\nWhen she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth.\n\u2018I thought he might inadvertently kill me,\u2019 said Ford.\n\u2018He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.\u2019\u201d Ms. Ford said she was able to escape the room and go home without any apparent further incident after \u201cKavanaugh\u2019s friend and classmate at Georgetown Preparatory School, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them, sending all three tumbling.\u201d\nHere is where Ms. Ford\u2019s story becomes quite murky and begins to fall apart.\nAlthough Ms. Ford believes the alleged incident occurred during the summer of 1982, she \u201csaid she does not remember some key details of the incident,\u201d according to the Washington Post article.\nFor example, Ms. Ford \u201csaid she does not remember how the gathering came together the night of the incident.\u201d She also does not remember how she got home.\nYet she claims to be absolutely certain that Kavanaugh, whom she presumably knew only as an acquaintance and said she had not spoken to since the night the incident allegedly occurred, was involved in the alleged incident.\nMs. Ford admitted that she \u201ctold no one at the time what had happened to her.\u201d In fact, she said she recalled thinking: \u201cI\u2019m not ever telling anyone this.\nThis is nothing, it didn\u2019t happen, and he didn\u2019t rape me.\u201d Even if one explains this behavior as the natural reaction of a frightened teenager to a highly traumatic incident, that does not explain why, by her own admission, she \u201ctold no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband,\u201d according to the Washington Post article.\nMost revealingly, the article reported on a gaping hole in the therapist\u2019s notes, portions of which were provided by Ms. Ford for the Washington Post\u2019s review.\nThe therapist\u2019s notes \u201cdo not mention Kavanaugh\u2019s name but say she reported that she was attacked by students \u2018from an elitist boys\u2019 school\u2019 who went on to become \u2018highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.\u2019\u201d\nIn other words, the only written documentation Ms. Ford has offered in support of her allegation about the incident she said took place while she was in high school \u2013 a therapist\u2019s notes of a couples therapy session occurring 30 years after the alleged incident \u2013 did not mention Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s name.\nJudge Kavanaugh has had extensive background checks performed on him in the past for his various federal government positions, including for his current position as a federal appellate court judge, without the accusation ever having surfaced.\nMs. Ford may believe her story to be true, but the lack of any credible corroborating evidence, her partial memory of details surrounding the alleged incident, and the absence of any pattern of such sexual misconduct by Judge Kavanaugh undercut the reliability of her version of the incident.\nIn a letter addressed to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) and Senator Feinstein, 65 women who said they knew Judge Kavanaugh in high school vouched for his character:\nWe are women who have known Brett Kavanaugh for more than 35 years and knew him while he attended high school between 1979 and 1983.\nFor the entire time we have known Brett Kavanaugh, he has behaved honorably and treated women with respect\u2026 Brett attended Georgetown Prep, an all-boys high school in Rockville, Maryland.\nHe was an outstanding student and athlete with a wide circle of friends.\nAlmost all of us attended all-girls high schools in the area.\nWe knew Brett well through social events, sports, church, and various other activities.\nMany of us have remained close friends with him and his family over the years.\nThrough the more than 35 years we have known him, Brett has stood out for his friendship, character, and integrity.\nIn particular, he has always treated women with decency and respect.\nThat was true when he was in high school, and it has remained true to this day.\nThe signers of this letter hold a broad range of political views.\nMany of us are not lawyers, but we know Brett Kavanaugh as a person.\nAnd he has always been a good person.\nNevertheless, using their standard contemptible, obstructionist tactics, the Democrats opposed to Judge Kavanaugh happily seized on the unsubstantiated allegation of teen sexual misbehavior in high school to assassinate Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s character.\nThey have done so in the face of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s lifetime record of stellar public service, multiple background checks producing no evidence of sexual misconduct, and the letter written by the 65 women, who knew him when he was in high school and thereafter and who signed their names to a ringing endorsement of his good character.\nFeminists gave the serial sexual predator Bill Clinton a free pass because his policies were in line with their ideology.\nSenator Feinstein called Ted \u201cChappaquiddick\u201d Kennedy an \"inspiration and a friend,\" presumably also based on their compatible ideologies.\nHypocritically exploiting an unsubstantiated allegation of decades-old purported teenage sexual mischief, Democrats seeking to torpedo Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation for ideological reasons have debased themselves with a shameless smear campaign against an eminently qualified candidate for the Supreme Court.\nPredictably, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other Democrats, including Senator Feinstein, have called for the Senate to postpone a vote on Judge Kavanaugh.\n\"Senator Grassley must postpone the vote until, at a very minimum, these serious and credible allegations are thoroughly investigated,\u201d Senator Schumer said.\nIf a thorough investigation was considered to be so important, why didn't Senator Feinstein set the ball rolling back in July when she first received word of the allegation?\nThe answer is that this is all a ruse to block Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation by all means necessary.\nSenator Schumer is fulfilling his promise to oppose Judge Kavanaugh with \"everything I've got.\"\nAs of now, the Senate Judiciary Committee Republican majority plans to move forward with Judge Kavanaugh's nomination as scheduled.\nIt is time for the Democrat obstructionists to slink back into their shadowy corner.\n", ["Doubt", "Loaded_Language", "Causal_Oversimplification", "Name_Calling,Labeling",

solid.\nThe allegations against Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 outlined now on the record in the Washington Post by Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford \u2014 are substantial and serious.\nShe claims that Kavanaugh knocked her down, groped her, and attempted to remove her clothes.\nHere\u2019s the core of her story:\nWhile his friend watched, she said, Kavanaugh pinned her to a bed on her back and groped her over her clothes, grinding his body against hers and clumsily attempting to pull off her one-piece bathing suit and the clothing she wore over it.\nWhen she tried to scream, she said, he put his hand over her mouth.\n\u201cI thought he might inadvertently kill me,\u201d said Ford, now a 51-year-old research psychologist in northern California.\n\u201cHe was trying to attack me and remove my clothing.\u201d Ford said she was able to escape when Kavanaugh\u2019s friend and classmate at Georgetown Preparatory School, Mark Judge, jumped on top of them, sending all three tumbling.\nShe said she ran from the room, briefly locked herself in a bathroom and then fled the house.\nDo not count me among those who would minimize this alleged assault.\nI went to a high school that had more than its share of drunken parties, and my classmates could do crazy and stupid things, but an act like this was beyond the pale.\nThis isn\u2019t \u201cboys will be boys.\u201d Actions have consequences, and it\u2019s hardly unjust to tell a person that if he mistreated another human being like this \u2014 even a long time ago \u2014 he has to remain \u201cmerely\u201d a judge on the D.C.\nCircuit Court of Appeals.\nSince Kavanaugh has denied the story, however, the question of whether the event is so egregious that it should disqualify him is moot.\nAt the very least, if the attack happened, he should be disqualified for lying.\nYet unless all parties start telling the same story, there is no way to know for certain if this event occurred.\nWe don\u2019t need certainty, however, to make a decision on whether a man should sit on the Supreme Court.\nI have the same standard for Brett Kavanaugh as I did for Roy Moore, for Donald Trump, for Bill Clinton \u2014 or for any other politician who\u2019s accused of misconduct.\nIs it more likely than not that the allegation is true?\nGiven the totality of the evidence, I believe it is more likely than not that Bill Clinton committed rape and sexual harassment.\nI believe it is more likely than not that Donald Trump has committed sexual assault.\nI believe it is more likely than not that Roy Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with underage girls.\nBut the evidence against Kavanaugh falls far short of the evidence arrayed against each of these men.\nSo far at least it falls far short of the evidence against virtually any other politician or celebrity who has faced consequences during this #MeToo moment.\nHere\u2019s why:\nFirst, one way to help test the veracity of old claims is to ask whether there is any contemporaneous corroboration.\nDid the accuser tell a friend or family member or anyone about the alleged assault when it occurred?\nWith Clinton, Trump, Moore, and many other politicians and celebrities, there was ample contemporaneous corroboration.\nHere, there was not.\nAccording to the Washington Post, \u201cFord said she told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband.\u201d\nThat\u2019s almost three decades of silence \u2014 three decades when memories can grow cloudy and recollections can change.\nBut even the allegedly corroborating notes of the therapist raise a separate problem.\nThey actually contradict her story on a key detail.\nAccording to the Post, \u201cThe notes say four boys were involved, a discrepancy that Ford says was an error on the therapist\u2019s part.\nFord said there were four boys at the party but only two in the room.\u201d Nor do the notes mention Kavanaugh\u2019s name, even though her husband says Ford named Kavanaugh in the sessions.\nThose are important discrepancies, and if six years ago she told the therapist four men and says two men now, that suggests that her memory of the event may be suspect.\nAs a former trial lawyer, I can tell you that while neither notes nor memories are infallible, in a contest between contemporaneous notes and later verbal testimony about those notes, the content of the written notes usually prevails.\nJuries are extremely skeptical of witnesses who contradict written notes \u2014 after all, the notes are taken when the words are immediate and there isn\u2019t the overwhelming pressure of a trial to conform your testimony to the desired outcome.\nAt least the investigation seems somewhat manageable.\nIf there were

declassify documents relating the Russian election meddling investigation yesterday.\nAmong the documents to be declassified are all of the text messages between disgraced FBI figures Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.\nThe documents to be declassified include all FBI reports on interviews with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and all FBI reports of interviews prepared in connection with all other applications to surveil Carter Page.\nTrump also asked that other important documents be declassified as well, including 21 pages worth of an application for a renewed surveillance warrant against former campaign aide Carter Page, according to Fox News.\nThe 21 pages Trump wants to be declassified only make up a small part of the 412 pages of FISA applications and warrants related to Page released by the FBI earlier this year in heavily redacted format.\nThe June 2017 application was the last of four filed by the Justice Department in support of FISA court orders allowing the monitoring of Page for nearly a year.\nAccording to the redacted version as reported by Fox News, three of the declassified pages contain information included in a section titled \u201cThe Russian Government\u2019s Coordinated Efforts to Influence the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election.\u201d That section includes reference to the potential coordination between people associated with Trump\u2019s campaign and the alleged Russian election interference effort.\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said President Trump had ordered the documents released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Justice Department \u201c[a]t the request of a number of committees of Congress, and for reasons of transparency.\u201d\nThe text messages are to be released \u201cwithout redaction,\u201d and those include messages from Ohr, Strzok, Lisa Page, former FBI Director James Comey, and former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.\nCarter Page told Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity on Monday night that the FBI\u2019s investigation was \u201cso incredibly stupid to begin with.\u201d He added, \u201cMy biggest concern is all the damage that this did to the U.S. government [and] the mockery it made out of the Constitution and all of the wrongdoing that was done by various officials within the Department of Justice, the FBI and the DNC [Democratic National Committee].\u201d\nIt is so far unknown when these documents will be declassified in an unredacted version, but it is safe to say that Democrats are probably panicking right about now.\nFox News further reported that a source familiar with the timing of the declassification told the media outlet that they expected the Carter Page warrant application to be declassified first, followed by the FBI reports on agent interviews with Ohr.\nA Justice Department spokesperson told Fox News that the DOJ and FBI \u201care already working with the Director of National Intelligence to comply with the

rehabilitation of the monster once known as Cardinal McCarrick for some five years before adverse worldwide press coverage forced to him to punish that serial homosexual rapist of whose crimes Vigan\u00f2 had personally informed him back in 2013\u2014information of which Bergoglio was clearly already aware at that time, as Vigan\u00f2 testifies.\nI never thought I\u2019d see the day when a preening, Internet-created neo-Catholic doyenne such as Simcha Fisher, as notorious as Mark Shea for her crude and often unprintable invective against traditionalists, would unload on Pope Bergoglio with the following headline: \u201cDoes Francis know he sounds like an abuser?\u201d\nThe scales have fallen from Fisher\u2019s eyes and now, at last, she sees Bergoglio, however grudgingly, for what he is: a power-mad ecclesiastical tyrant.\n(A tyrant, moreover, who has ascended to the papacy in a manner reminiscent of the ascension of the corrupt Benedict IX, another \u201cdisgrace to the Chair of Peter,\u201d following the machinations of a Roman cabal, as I discuss below.)\nQuoth Fisher:\nI have a number of friends who have escaped abusive marriages.\nThey tell me that Pope Francis is sounding more and more like the men who abused them.\nHe\u2019s sounding like the men who hid that abuse from the world, who taught their victims to blame themselves, who used spiritual pressure to persuade them and their families that it would actually be wrong, sinful, to defend themselves.\nJust listen to him.\nAfter responding to a question about Vigano\u2019s very serious accusations, he said point blank, \u201cI will not say a single word on this.\u201d\u2026 [F]or the rest of the week and more, he kept up an unmistakable theme of calling for silence, equating silence with holiness, and painting himself as a Christlike victim in his silence.\nThen he says it\u2019s \u201cugly\u201d to accuse others of sinning.\nThen he suggests that healing and reconciliation will only come if we take a hard look at our own flaws\u2026.\nTo the victims of the Church, and to those who love them, it sounds like he is saying, \u201cWho do you think you are?\nI don\u2019t have to explain myself to you.\nYou\u2019re the guilty one.\nYou brought this on yourself.\nIf you want to be loved, then know your place.\nI\u2019m the victim, here, not you.\nIf you know what\u2019s good for you, keep your mouth shut.\u201d This is how abusers talk.\nThey\u2019re not content with power; they have to keep their victims doubting and blaming themselves constantly, so they don\u2019t become a threat.\nWhether Francis knows it or not, this is how he sounds.\nWe can overlook the fig leaf \u201cwhether Francis knows it or not\u2026\u201d.\nFisher knows that Francis knows it, even if she still cannot bring herself to say explicitly what should now be apparent to the entire body of the faithful: that Bergoglio\u2019s very presence on the Chair of Peter is a grave threat to the common good of the Church and the integrity of the Faith.\nClick below to Subscribe to The Remnant's YouTube channel!\nYet Fisher maintains a sliver of space for deniability in order to maintain that indispensable distinction between her and those loathsome traditionalists: \u201cI don\u2019t have any ideological reason to want to bring him down.\nI have defended him as long as I could, up until the Chile debacle.\nAnd so I am working as hard as I can not to assume the worst, not to believe that this man who promised so much fresh air is really so intent on slamming doors shut before we find out even worse things hidden inside.\nBut he is not making it easy.\nI am not saying he is an abuser.\nBut he sounds like one.\u201d\nThat is, Fisher was not concerned about Bergoglio\u2019s relentless assault on traditional Catholic teaching and practice\u2014to her, opposition to Francis on that account is just \u201cideology\u201d\u2014but only his role in covering up sexual abuse by bishops and priests.\nBut why is Fisher still \u201cworking hard not to assume the worst\u201d when there is no longer anything to assume as the ever-mounting evidence of malintent has been in plain view for years?\nIndeed, why else did Archbishop Vigan\u00f2 risk everything in order to expose this Pope, even to the extent of revealing matters supposedly within the scope of \u201cthe Pontifical secret\u201d?\nOn orders of the Vatican Secretary of State, the Vatican secret police are reportedly scouring the globe in search of Vigan\u00f2, who has gone into hiding, \u201cin order to prevent more unpredictable damage to the image of Pope Francis and the Holy See on the world stage, but also to \u2018prepare the terrain\u2019 for the former apostolic nuncio-turned-whistleblower to be prosecuted\u201d under canon law.\nThe Dictator Pope must destroy his most potent critic thus far.\nEverything depends on it!\nBut it may already be too late to save a regime whose only defense is not truth but raw power.\nAt last count, some 29 bishops have publicly declared Vigan\u00f2\u2019s allegations against Bergoglio credible and worthy of investigation.\nNow even the distinguished canonist Edward Peters, who is no less than a Referendary of the Apostolic Signatura appointed by Pope Benedict XVI, declares that if Vigan\u00f2\u2019s allegations are true then Bergoglio must go:\nOf what was said above concerning resignation from Church office in general, what would not apply to a pope, of all office holders, if he, as alleged by Vigan\u00f2, from the first months of his papacy knowingly protected and favored a cardinal who was [pick a disgusting verb]-ing seminarians?\nBy what possible stretch of the imagination would such an occupant be suited for the Chair of Peter?\nDoes the historical fact that some pretty bad popes held on to office despite committing various offenses justify other popes acting badly in shirking even the minimal gesture of resigning?\nVigan\u00f2 is unquestionably in a position to know, and claims to know, whether his central allegation that Francis\u2019 was covering for McCarrick, big time, for years, is correct.\nBelieving, as he does, that his claims are correct, Vigan\u00f2, in calling for Francis\u2019 resignation, has done nothing more or less than exercise his right under canon law \u201cto manifest to the sacred pastors [his] opinion on matters which pertain to the good of the Church and to make [his] opinion known to the rest of the Christian faithful\u2026\u201d 1983 CIC 212 \u00a7 3.\nI have not called for Francis\u2019 resignation because I do not know (with the degree of certitude that a lawyer seeks) whether Vigan\u00f2\u2019s key allegations against Francis are substantially true; most assuredly, however, if I reach the conclusion that they are true, I would say, without hesitation, that Francis should resign.\nBergoglio will not, of course, resign.\nHe will cling to power with his last breath in order to carry out the many other acts of ecclesial subversion he clearly has in mind.\nThe only remedies for the plague of Bergoglio are his natural death or deposition.\nYes, deposition.\nCanon212 has linked to an interesting and timely piece on the role of the Synod of Sutri, near Rome, in 1046, which dealt with the problem of three rival claimants to the papacy, each installed by a Roman faction: First, the execrable Benedict IX, mentioned above.\nSecond, the interloper Sylvester III, installed in the Chair of Peter after Benedict had been driven from Rome.\nThird, the well-intentioned but dimwitted Gregory VI, whose election was tainted by a seemingly simoniacal negotiation with Benedict, who had returned to Rome in 1045 and ousted Sylvester, according to which Benedict would receive a generous pension if he resigned the papacy, which Benedict did only to rescind his resignation.\nThe Synod was convoked by Henry III, the German king and soon-to-be-crowned Holy Roman Emperor, a pious and austere Christian and an exponent of the Cluniac spirit of reform.\nThe Synod declared that Benedict IX (who had refused to appear) was deposed notwithstanding his attempt to undo his resignation.\nAs for Sylvester, the Synod declared that he be \u201cstripped of his sacerdotal rank and shut up in a monastery.\u201d Gregory was also declared deposed, either by the act of the Synod itself or by Gregory\u2019s own voluntary resignation in view of the Synod.\nAt Henry III\u2019s designation, the German Bishop of Bamberg became Clement II, but he died after only a year, whereupon Benedict reasserted his claim to the papacy for the third time in 1047, only to be driven from Rome again by Imperial troops in 1048.\nDamasus II, another German bishop designated by Henry, reigned for a mere three weeks before dying, whereupon Pope St. Leo IX succeeded to the papacy, reigning until 1054.\nLeo, as John Rao observes, was the first in a line of Popes who \u201ctook charge of the movement of innovative Christian restoration\u201d which included a breaking of the dominance of Roman nobility over papal elections.\n(Rao, Black Legends, 147-148).\nAs the cited article on the Synod of Sutri notes, although the scurrilous Benedict IX objected to his deposition by the Synod, \u201cthe Church has always accepted his deposition as valid.\nThe King of Germany then appointed Clement II as Pope, who promptly crowned the King, Holy Roman Emperor.\nBenedict IX, after the death of Clement, claimed the papacy again!\nThe Church to this day recognizes Clement II as a true Pope.\u201d\nMoreover, Benedict IX himself is recognized as a true Pope\u2014a valid but deposed Pope\u2014during three separate periods listed as three distinct pontificates in the canon of Popes.\nThis was possible owing to the lack of any set canonical form for papal elections; a Pope could gain or regain the office by various machinations.\nIndeed, even the Vatican\u2019s own website states that Benedict was Pope from 1047-1048, the very year of his third ascension to the office from which he was finally driven by force.\nOnly with the ascension of Pope Nicholas II in 1059 was it established that henceforth the cardinal-bishops would elect the Pope, with the other cardinals having the right to confirm or veto the nominee.\nBy 1100 what we now know as the College of Cardinals, embracing all the cardinals of different titles, had the exclusive right to elect a Pope, and the members of the College \u201chave held it ever since.\u201d (Eric John, The Popes, 181).\nThese lessons of history should suffice to dispel the pious fable, never a teaching of the Magisterium, that every Pope is chosen by the Holy Ghost to lead the Church.\nThis theological error, which Bergoglio has exploited to the hilt, is a key element in the related error of papalotry, which elevates the person of the Pope above the office he occupies and makes of him the leader of a personality cult everyone is commanded to \u201clove\u201d (in the superficially emotional sense) and obey no matter what he says or does, rather than a custodian and defender of the Deposit of Faith whose lovability, personality and opinions are utterly irrelevant to the exercise and scope of his office.\nAs Pope Benedict has observed, when it comes to the election of a Pope \u201cthe Spirit\u2019s role should be understood in a much more elastic sense, not that he [sic] dictates the candidate for whom one must vote\u2026.\nThere are too many contrary instances of popes the Holy Spirit obviously would not have picked!\u201d Bergoglio is undeniably one of them.\nSo what can be done to defend the Church against Bergoglio?\nThat the mode of papal election by cardinals has persisted for nearly a thousand years has led to the general impression that it pertains to the irreformable divine constitution of the Church, but it certainly does not.\nAs to matters of purely ecclesiastical law such as this one the Church has always allowed for departures from traditional practice in cases of emergency or grave necessity.\nAnd just as a synod was employed to address three rival claimants to the papal throne in 1046, declaring at least two of them deposed, so today might it be possible for reform-minded cardinals and bishops, comprising an imperfect council, to undo the incalculable damage caused by the cabal that lobbied for Bergoglio\u2019s election before the last conclave\u2014a cabal that included none other than McCarrick, whom Bergoglio rewarded by rehabilitating that monster despite the massive evidence of his unspeakable crimes.\nWhat would be the grounds for a declaration of deposition at such a gathering of prelates?\nOne could readily point to the evidence that a faction that included Bergoglio himself had agreed upon his election before the conclave, and that all those involved, including Bergoglio, were thereby excommunicated latae sententiae in accordance with Article 81 of John Paul II\u2019s Universi Dominici Gregis, which provides:\nThe Cardinal electors shall further abstain from any form of pact, agreement, promise or other commitment of any kind which could oblige them to give or deny their vote to a person or persons.\nIf this were in fact done, even under oath, I decree that such a commitment shall be null and void and that no one shall be bound to observe it; and I hereby impose the penalty of excommunication latae sententiae upon those who violate this prohibition.\nTo quote Cajetan on this point (citations taken from the linked article by Robert Siscoe), deposition by an imperfect council is appropriate \u201cwhen one or more Popes suffer uncertainty with regard to their election, as seems to have arisen in the schism of Urban VI and others.\nThen, lest the Church be perplexed, those members of the Church who are available have the power to judge which is the true pope, if it can be known, and if it cannot be known, [it has] the power to provide that the electors agree on one or another of them.\u201d\nI am not saying that such a case has been proven.\nRather, what I am saying is that this hypothetical imperfect council could determine that it has been proven and act accordingly, and that the Church would judge any resulting deposition of Bergoglio in the same manner it judges the deposition of Benedict IX.\nAnother ground for deposition\u2014as determined by the imperfect council, not any of us\u2014would be that Bergoglio has deposed himself by promulgating heresy, fracturing the Church\u2019s universal discipline respecting marriage and the Eucharist, and undermining the teaching of even his own immediate predecessors on matters of fundamental morality upheld by the Magisterium for two millennia.\nSurely the Church cannot be without any remedy for a Pope who relentlessly attacks her very foundations!\nTo quote Cajetan again: \u201cIndeed the Church has the right to separate herself from an heretical pope according to divine law.\nConsequently, it has the right, by the same divine law, to use all means of themselves necessary for such separation; and those that juridically correspond to the crime, are of themselves necessary\u201d\u2014meaning the resort to an imperfect council.\nIf a synod was able to declare the deposition of a pope in 1046, why not an imperfect council today\u2014or, for that matter, another synod?\nIt will be argued that such a deposition would provoke massive schisms in the Church.\nBut that would not be the first time that defense of the Church\u2019s common good has done so, as the Great Western Schism demonstrates.\nAnd are we not in the midst of schisms already, provoked by none other than Bergoglio himself, whose insane drive to shatter the Church\u2019s bimillennial discipline has produced the totally unprecedented situation in which what is still considered mortally sinful in one diocese is an imperative of \u201cmercy\u201d in another?\nIn any case, this much is certain: barring Bergoglio\u2019s conversion and reversal of course, the Church cannot abide this pontificate any longer.\nOne way or another, the Church will have to repel an attacker at her very summit.\nEither the human element of the Church will act according to the means which seem possible, however extraordinary, or Heaven itself will intervene in a manner that might well involve a divine chastisement due to the negligence of time-serving pastors who left their sheep completely undefended against the wolves who preyed upon them, including the wolf the cardinals improvidently elected Pope.\nSome four months before Archbishop Vigan\u00f2\u2019s testimony Cardinal Willem Jacobus Eijk, the Archbishop of Utrecht, Netherlands, perhaps the most liberal territory in the entire Church, protested that Bergoglio\u2019s blatant nod to intercommunion with Protestants in Germany means that \u201cthe bishops and, above all, the Successor of Peter fail to maintain and transmit faithfully and in unity the deposit of faith contained in Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture\u201d and that the situation reminds him of Article 675 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which refers to the Church\u2019s \u201cfinal trial\u201d before the Second Coming, \u201cthat will shake the faith of many believers\u2026 [a] \u2018mystery of iniquity\u2019 in the form of a religious deception offering men an apparent solution to their problems at the price of apostasy from the truth.\nWhat can the Church do when confronted by a Pope who, as a prominent cardinal declares to the whole world, \u201cfail[s] to maintain and transmit faithfully \u2026 the deposit of faith contained in Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture\u201d and is leading \u201can apostasy from the truth\u201d?\nIt seems absurd to argue that she can do nothing but exhort the faithful to pray and do penance while a papal malefactor, treated as if were an absolute dictator, is allowed to continue wreaking havoc upon faith and morals to the detriment of countless souls, without the least impediment, for so long as he shall live.\nNo, Bergoglio must go.\nThe successors of the Apostles, the only ones in a position to end his rampage, must demand his resignation and, should he refuse as expected, act in this unprecedented emergency to declare his removal from the office he has criminally abused and whose very credibility he threatens to destroy.\nMay God give them the grace to do what must be done and what history will vindicate as a rescue of the Church during the height of the worst crisis in her history.\n", ["Appeal_to_fear-prejudice", "Black-and-White_Fallacy", "Doubt", "Exaggeration,Minimisation", "Loaded_Language",

continuing success in delaying a confirmation vote on Judge Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court reveals its malicious agenda to block the nominee from sitting on the high court when its new term begins Monday, October 1.\nDemocrats had Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s never-credible accusations of sexual abuse -- including possible attempted rape -- in hand way back in the summer.\nThey deliberately refused to bring up the allegations, as weak and ridiculous as they are, at Kavanaugh\u2019s Senate confirmation hearings because they didn\u2019t want to have a rational discussion.\nThey wanted to hurl the wild claims like a grenade at the last minute to blow up the process.\nAnd so far it appears they\u2019re succeeding.\nIf Kavanaugh isn\u2019t in place a week from Monday, the Supreme Court will begin hearing cases in its new term shorthanded.\nThe high court normally has a complement of nine justices but with Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, there have only been eight justices in place.\nRoughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court.\nDemocrats would prefer to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they hope to take control from Republicans.\nElection Day is November 6.\nThe GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49.\nChristine Blasey Ford\u2019s lawyers are trying to game the system.\nThey know that Senate Judiciary Committee rules require Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) to provide a full week\u2019s notice for a hearing.\nSo, if, for example, the committee followed the rules and agreed Friday (today) to a hearing, the soonest it could be held would be next Friday, the final business day before the Supreme Court\u2019s new term begins.\nOf course, lawyers are masters of delay, and social justice warrior-lawyers hoping to torpedo President Trump\u2019s agenda have an added incentive to drag the confirmation process out as long as possible.\nNew demands and fake emergencies are bound to arise from Ford\u2019s legal team.\nIt was unclear at press time if the public hearing scheduled for Monday into the allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh would go forward.\nKavanaugh informed the committee he was willing to testify Monday.\n\u201cI continue to want a hearing as soon as possible, so that I can clear my name,\" he wrote in a letter.\nFord's lawyer Debra Katz told the Judiciary Committee her client \"wishes to testify, provided that we can agree on terms that are fair and which ensure her safety.\"\nAnother Ford attorney reportedly said Wednesday that there are \u201cmultiple witnesses\u201d who need to testify.\n\"A hearing on Monday is not possible and the Committee's insistence that it occur then is arbitrary in any event,\u201d Katz wrote in a letter.\n\u201cDr.\nFord has asked me to let you know that she appreciates the various options you have suggested.\nHer strong preference continues to be for the Senate Judiciary Committee to allow for a full investigation prior to her testimony.\u201d\nGOP lawmakers are figuring out how to respond to Ford\u2019s request, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports:\nLate Thursday, Sen.

you don't like running for public office or being nominated for a position, some woman crawls out from a line of protesters and makes an ambiguous-at-best claim about unwanted sexual advances, it becomes increasingly difficult to take you seriously.\nNo, an accusation against a man who has been investigated by the FBI six times prior and has 75 women publicly vouching for his character is not

accusations against Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh in order to sink his candidacy.\nNow that Christine Blasey Ford has finally agreed to testify this Thursday at an open hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding her charge that Judge Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a long-ago high school party, these new charges have suddenly emerged from left field.\nOn Sunday, a former classmate from Judge Kavanaugh's time at Yale accused the Supreme Court nominee of exposing himself to her at a party.\nThe New Yorker has just published an article written by Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer, based on information that was reportedly sent to at least four Democratic senators.\nThe article recounted a claim by Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s, concerning \u201ca dormitory party gone awry.\u201d As the article acknowledged, however, \u201cher memories contained gaps because she had been drinking at the time of the alleged incident.\u201d The article goes on to say that in her initial conversations with The New Yorker, Ms. Ramirez was \u201creluctant to characterize Kavanaugh\u2019s role in the alleged incident with certainty.\u201d It was only after \u201csix days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney\u201d that Ms. Ramirez was suddenly able to pinpoint Judge Kavanaugh as having committed an unsavory act, even though she admitted being \u201cfoggy\u201d at the time.\nThe New Yorker article also noted that the magazine \u201chas not confirmed with other eyewitnesses that Kavanaugh was present at the party.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the ever-present Michael Avenatti, attorney of porn star Stormy Daniels, tweeted that he had information from anonymous sources that Judge Kavanaugh and his friend had \"targeted\" women with drugs and alcohol at parties to facilitate \"gang rape.\"\nHaters of Judge Kavanaugh are turning the process of Senate confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee into something worse than a travesty.\nHis opponents in the Senate have transformed their \u201cadvise and consent\u201d function into a campaign of no-holds barred character assassination.\nWhile Judge Kavanaugh weathers these latest accusations, which he adamantly denies, his real test will be on Thursday, assuming that Christine Blasey Ford will follow through on her agreement to testify at an open hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nHer attorneys stalled for a week before making the announcement that Ms. Ford would testify despite certain \u201cunresolved\u201d issues.\nAmong the issues Ms. Ford\u2019s attorneys have raised was the refusal of the committee to subpoena one of the purported witnesses, Mark Judge, who Ms. Ford reportedly claims was involved in the alleged incident, as well as \u201cwho on the Majority side will be asking the questions, whether senators or staff attorneys.\"\nA week has already gone by since Ms. Ford went public with her story in an interview with the Washington Post while Ms. Ford and her attorneys stalled for time.\nThey raised one procedural issue after another while claiming that the committee majority was \u201cbullying\u201d Ms. Ford.\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-I) has bent over backwards to accommodate Ms. Ford\u2019s preferred scheduling for her appearance.\nHe extended the deadline several times for her to come to a decision on whether to testify at all.\nHe had offered various options for her to testify publicly or privately or to be interviewed by committee staff in her home state of California, whichever setting would make her more comfortable.\nHowever, in Senator Grassley\u2019s e-mail thanking Ms. Ford for finally agreeing to a time certain for her testimony, Senator Grassley correctly reminded her attorneys that \u201cthe committee determines which witnesses to call, how many witnesses to call, and what order to call them and who will question them.\nThese are nonnegotiable.\u201d\nWhile the negotiations with Ms. Ford\u2019s attorneys for her testimony were underway, Democrats were sitting on the latest allegations, ready to pounce as soon as Ms. Ford\u2019s accusation was about to be heard.\nSome Democrats are already using the Ramirez episode to push anew for a fresh FBI investigation and to postpone Thursday\u2019s scheduled hearing.\nIdeally, if the Democrats cannot apply enough pressure to force a withdrawal of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination through their relentless campaign of character assassination, they want to push any Senate votes until after the midterm elections at the earliest.\nThen they will claim that the newly elected senators should be involved in the confirmation decision.\nIn the meantime, Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s adversaries in the Senate, the mainstream media and progressive circles continue to bludgeon Judge Kavanaugh in the court of public opinion.\nAll of their stratagems are an obvious attempt to buy time in order to persuade any wavering senators that Judge Kavanaugh is too tainted by sexual assault charges \u2013 whether proven or not - to sit on the Supreme Court.\nProof does not matter to those wanting to bring Judge Kavanaugh down at any cost.\nRegarding Ms. Ford\u2019s accusation, they know that the proof so far is non-existent, aside from Ms. Ford\u2019s own assertions contained in her confidential letter given to Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, last July, and in her Washington Post interview.\nWhile a redacted version of Ms. Ford\u2019s letter has been published, Senator Feinstein has refused to date to give even Senator Grassley a copy of the completely unredacted version.\nThe FBI has already conducted 6 background checks, no federal crime is alleged, and there is no forensic evidence to investigate after 30 years at a site that Ms. Ford cannot even identify.\nWhat we do know so far tends to undercut the credibility of Ms. Ford\u2019s accusation.\nMs. Ford cannot corroborate her decades-old charge of sexual assault against Judge Kavanaugh.\nWhatever corroboration Ms. Ford was hoping for from \u201cwitnesses\u201d she claimed were at the alleged party is non-existent.\nThe individuals she reportedly named in her unredacted confidential letter given to Senator Feinstein have either denied being at such a party or do not recollect what Ms. Ford has alleged.\nMoreover, by her own admission to the Washington Post, Ms. Ford \u201csaid she does not remember some key details of the incident.\u201d She does not remember, for example, where it happened, how the party came together in the first place, or how she got home after the alleged incident.\nShe believes the alleged incident occurred during the summer of 1982, but reportedly could not be more precise on the day or even the month of the party.\nAfraid that Ms. Ford\u2019s sexual assault allegation could be readily challenged and anxious to establish some sort of pattern of sexual misconduct beyond this single alleged incident, the Kavanaugh haters have latched onto Ms. Ramirez\u2019s story.\nThe New York Times published an op-ed column last week by a psychiatrist, Richard A. Friedman, who cited neurological science to conclude that Ms. Ford\u2019s claim that she has \u201ca vivid memory of an attack that took place when she was 15\u201d is \u201ccredible.\u201d The reason, he wrote, is that \u201cmemories formed under the influence of intense emotion \u2014 such as the feelings that accompany a sexual assault \u2014 are indelible in the way that memories of a routine day are not.\u201d The only problem with Dr. Friedman\u2019s thesis is that Ms. Ford has apparently forgotten such key details surrounding the alleged sexual assault as when and where it happened and how she got home.\nMoreover, when Ms. Ford finally told someone about the incident in any detail some 30 years later in 2012, during a couples therapy session with her husband, she did not name Judge Kavanaugh specifically, according to the therapist\u2019s notes that Ms. Ford had provided to the Washington Post in connection with her interview.\nThe Washington Post reported that the therapist\u2019s notes it reviewed \u201cdo not mention Kavanaugh\u2019s name but say she reported that she was attacked by students \u2018from an elitist boys\u2019 school\u2019 who went on to become \u2018highly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.\u2019\u201d\nMs. Ramirez\u2019s story is even less credible.\nIt took an attorney and six days of very belated reflection to help revive her memory of an incident she claimed happened while she herself was very drunk.\nSenator Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), one of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s fiercest critics who told men to \u201cshut up\u201d regarding Ms. Ford\u2019s allegations, said she doubts Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s credibility because of \u201chow he approaches his cases.\u201d Aside from mischaracterizing the constitutional textualist reasoning underlying Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s opinions, she is saying that she does not believe Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s denial of the sexual misconduct allegations lodged against him because of the opinions he wrote that she does not like.\nSuch circular \u201creasoning\u201d would be amusing if it were not so emblematic of what one writer called \u201cKavanaugh Derangement Syndrome.\"\nSenator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) is also suffering from the same syndrome.\nShe said Thursday regarding Ms. Ford: \"I believe her because she is telling the truth and you know it by her story.\"\nMs. Ford\u2019s supporters are exploiting the \u201cMe Too\u201d movement to declare Judge Kavanaugh guilty simply because Ms. Ford is a woman who has made what they call, without any corroborating evidence to date, a \u201ccredible\u201d charge.\nThe same would presumably be the case for Ms. Ramirez.\nThey argue that since the Senate Judiciary Committee is not a criminal judicial trial, but rather a legislative hearing for confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee, the normal burden of proof shouldered by the accuser should not apply.\nJudge Kavanaugh should have to prove that he is not guilty, they are in effect insisting.\nThis is another case of Kavanaugh Derangement Syndrome.\nLet\u2019s assume for the sake of argument that the normal burden on the prosecution in a criminal case - to prove the accused\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt - is not applicable regarding the charge against Judge Kavanaugh since he is not a defendant in a criminal trial.\nHowever, that should not flip the burden of proof onto Judge Kavanaugh altogether.\nJudge Kavanaugh is being subjected to charges of a criminal nature that could not only deprive him of a seat on the Supreme Court for which he is otherwise eminently qualified.\nMs. Ford\u2019s unsubstantiated accusation can completely destroy Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s life by causing irreparable damage to his reputation for integrity and good character and to his career, which he has built up during decades of public service.\nHis family\u2019s lives have been completely upended.\nPlacing the burden on Judge Kavanaugh to prove that he was not involved in an uncorroborated incident from years ago, about which even his accuser does not recall key details, turns the fundamental constitutional principle of due process upside down.\nMs. Ford should have the burden to prove her accusations by at least a preponderance of all the evidence presented.\nThis charade must come to an end.\nNo more extensions for Ms. Ford to come forward and testify.\nIf Ms. Ford does not follow through with her agreement to testify in an open Senate Judiciary Committee hearing this Thursday and do so upon the conditions set by the committee, she should go home while the committee proceeds to an immediate vote on Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination.\nIf Ms. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh do testify, the senators deciding on whether to confirm Judge Kavanaugh as well as the American public following the testimony must remember one cardinal rule.\nIn a nation guided by fairness and law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.\nSadly, many of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s haters have thrown that rule aside.\nIf Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination is pulled as a result of the smears and character assassination, President Trump should immediately nominate someone on his short list such as Amy Coney Barrett and the Senate Republican majority should then push through the new nominee\u2019s confirmation as soon as possible.\nDelay is not an option.\n", ["Repetition", "Flag-Waving", "Doubt", "Exaggeration,Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Causal_Oversimplification", "Name_Calling,Labeling", "Appeal_to_Authority", "Slogans"]], ["The Left\u2019s Show Trial for Kavanaugh\nTwo more women accusing Judge Brett Kavanaugh of dubious improprieties materialized out of thin air late Sunday, throwing Senate Republicans\u2019 hope of finally confirming the Supreme Court nominee this week even more into doubt.\nThe new allegations came yesterday amid reports that Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) tentatively scheduled a hearing for this Thursday to take testimony from Christine Blasey Ford, 51, who claims Kavanaugh, 53, sexually assaulted her decades ago when he was a high school student.\nSuspiciously, Ford can\u2019t \u2013or won\u2019t\u2014 say when or where the alleged incident happened and can provide few details.\nAs Paul Sperry writes at the New York Post, working with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and backed financially by George Soros\u2019s money, Ford\u2019s lawyers spent the last few days gaming the system.\nAfter stalling Grassley and getting repeated extensions, the attorneys got the chairman to cave on various demands, such as that Kavanaugh not be in the room when Ford gives evidence.\nRepublicans never seem to learn from their mistakes.\nAs usual, Republicans\u2019 seeming reasonableness is rewarded with more abuse by the Left.\nGive left-wingers an inch and they\u2019ll take a mile.\nDemocrats, it turns out, used the extra time created through their delaying tactics to produce two new women with questionable claims against Kavanaugh.\nMore accusers could be on their way.\nPresident Trump continues to support Kavanaugh, who maintains his innocence.\n\u201cThis alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen,\u201d the nominee said Sunday of Ford\u2019s accusations.\n\u201cThe people who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so.\nThis is a smear, plain and simple.\nI look forward to testifying on Thursday about the truth, and defending my good name \u2014 and the reputation for character and integrity I have spent a lifetime building \u2014 against these last-minute allegations.\u201d\nIf Kavanaugh isn\u2019t on the bench on October 1, the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term.\nThe high court normally has a complement of nine justices but with Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, there have only been only eight justices in place.\nRoughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court.\nDemocrats would prefer to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they stand a good chance of taking control from Republicans.\nElection Day is November 6.\nThe GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49.\nMeanwhile, the New Yorker magazine reported Sunday that Deborah Ramirez, 53, suddenly claims to have been assaulted by Kavanaugh at a drunken party decades ago at Yale College.\nRamirez claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and brushed his genitals against her.\nAlso on Sunday, media-savvy sleazeball lawyer Michael Avenatti, who represents porn star Stormy Daniels, tweeted that he represents another woman who plans to accuse Kavanaugh of something.\n\u201cI represent a woman with credible information regarding Judge Kavanaugh and Mark Judge.\nWe will be demanding the opportunity to present testimony to the committee and will likewise be demanding that Judge and others be subpoenaed to testify,\u201d Avenatti wrote on Twitter.\n\u201cMy client is not Deborah Ramirez.\u201d\nWashington insiders still believe Kavanaugh will be confirmed, or at least they did before the two new accusers popped up.\nFor example, at a Friday afternoon preview of upcoming cases in the Supreme Court\u2019s approaching October term that was hosted by the Federalist Society, panelist Thomas C. Goldstein of the law firm of Goldstein & Russell predicted that the high court would have nine members again soon.\n\u201cThere is exactly a zero percent chance that [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley will allow this thing to get past the lame-duck\u201d congressional session after Election Day, said the co-founder of SCOTUSblog who has appeared before the Supreme Court many times.\n\u201cI think we ought to recognize that.\nThe prospect that the Democrats will take the Senate, albeit thin, is realistic, and so they will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure that there is a ninth member of the court there by the time a Democratic majority could take over in the Senate in January.\u201d\nWe\u2019ll see soon enough if Goldstein\u2019s prediction comes true.\n", ["Exaggeration,Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Name_Calling,Labeling", "Doubt"]], ["Stop Appeasing the Democrats\nBruce Thornton is a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the David Horowitz Freedom Center.\nFrom the playground to geopolitics, appeasing an aggressor invites only more aggression.\nThis timeless truth of human nature is one that we moderns can\u2019t seem to accept.\nWe reflexively assume that a rational accommodation or concessions will be reciprocated by those proven to be ready to use any means necessary to achieve their aims, no matter how amoral, unfair, or vicious.\nBrett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court illustrate that this false assumption leads only to more demands, and ultimately to defeat.\nThe last-minute accusations from Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who claims that decades ago Kavanaugh groped her at a high school party, and Deborah Ramirez, who accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her at a frat party at Yale, are transparent acts of aggression against the judge and Republicans, one engineered by the Democrats.\nSenator Dianne Feinstein sat for months on Ford\u2019s letter and then\u2013\u2013just as the Dems did in 1991with Anita Hill\u2019s charges of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas\u2019s during his hearings\u2013\u2013released it only when Kavanaugh appeared to be heading for confirmation.\nFeinstein still hasn\u2019t given the Judiciary Committee an unredacted copy of the letter.\nA few weeks after Ford went public, and after Kavanaugh said he had dairies from that summer detailing his whereabouts, The New Yorker published Ramirez\u2019s account of a drunken party filled with obscene drinking games where he exposed himself to Ramirez.\nGiven that the Democrats had made public in advance their intention to derail the hearings and confirmation by any means possible, the timing of both sexual assault charges reeks of premeditated contrivance intended to delay confirmation as long as possible.\nBut in the face of this naked ploy to bork Kavanaugh and derail the confirmation process for partisan advantage, the Republicans seem to be reverting to their customary preemptive cringe.\nAll the Dems have to do is squeal \u201csexism\u201d and Republicans start negotiating and offering concessions.\nOf course, after each concession comes another demand.\nFirst the Dems demanded that Ford, a long-time Democrat activist, \u201cbe heard.\u201d So last week the Chairman of Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley, granted another deadline extension for Ford to decide whether to testify before the Committee on Monday.\nSenator Dianne Feinstein calls these concessions \u201cbullying deadlines.\u201d As Feinstein put it, \u201cShow some heart.\nWait until Dr. Ford feels that she can come before the committee.\u201d Ford doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d like she can testify on Monday because she\u2019s afraid of flying, despite offers from the Committee to travel to her in California.\nThen she feared for her life because of death threats \u2013\u2013threats also made to Kavanaugh, his wife and two young daughters\u2013\u2013 so she now demands enhanced security measures.\nThe Committee caved and moved the date to Thursday.\nSo of course, Grassley having been intimidated into giving Ford a chance to address the Committee, Ramirez and her handlers are now demanding the same privilege.\n\u201cCreepy Lawyer\u201d for porn star Stormy Daniels claims to represent a woman who also should be allowed to testify to the Senate Committee about Kavanaugh\u2019s partying habits while at Yale.\nWe\u2019ll have to see whether Grassley can find the stomach to put an end to the farce of allowing unsubstantiated charges from Democrat activists to waste the Committee\u2019s time.\nFord and Dianne Feinstein also keep demanding an FBI investigation, even though no federal crime is being alleged, and any investigation 36 years after the offense is impossible.\nFord can\u2019t remember where and when the alleged assault took place, nor how she got to or went home from the party where it allegedly occurred.\nHer own details of the event don\u2019t jibe (Four boys or three?\nOne girl or two?).\nShe told no one about the assault until 30 years later.\nA \u201clifelong friend\u201d whom Ford claims was at the party has denied any knowledge of the it, and says she\u2019s never met Kavanaugh.\nAnother friend who reported that the school was abuzz with gossip about the attack (which apparently took place during summer break), retracted her statement.\nThe two men Ford named as possible witnesses to the assault have contradicter her claims under oath.\nAnd the accused Judge Kavanaugh also under oath vehemently denies the charges.\nGiven that 36 years have passed since the incident, and the accuser\u2019s memory is so hazy and short on coherent details, the FBI has nothing to investigate.\nRamirez\u2019s charge is even flimsier.\nHere\u2019s a catalogue from the Daily Wire:\n1.\nThe New Yorker could not find a single witness who could put Kavanaugh at the alleged party.\n2.\nThe New York Times could not find a single person who could corroborate Ramirez\u2019s claims.\n3.\nThe man accused of egging on Kavanaugh denied Ramirez's allegations and vouched for Kavanaugh\u2019s character.\n4.\nA third person that Ramirez claimed was at the party says she was not there for the alleged incident.\n5.\nRamirez contacted her former classmates, asking about the incident, and admitted she was not sure that Kavanaugh was the male who exposed himself.\n6.\nA woman who claims she was \u201cbest friends\u201d with Ramirez says Ramirez never mentioned the story and initially said her friend's accusations against Kavanaugh might be \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d\n7.\nRamirez, just like Christine Blasey Ford, is a registered Democrat and is dedicated to leftist causes.\n8.\nRamirez wasn\u2019t even sure her memory was correct \u2014 until she spent six days going over it with her Democrat lawyer.\n9.\nRamirez admits there are holes in her memory due to how much she drank at the party.\n10.\nPeople who knew Ramirez after her time at Yale say that she never once mentioned the incident \u2014 until Kavanaugh's nomination was pending.\nNo law enforcement agency, let alone the FBI, would waste its time with an allegation of a crime decades in the past, and so patently incoherent and lacking in evidence.\nThe \u201cFBI investigation\u201d is another delaying tactic.\nFord has finally agreed to testify, set for Thursday for now.\nBut it\u2019s unclear whether Grassley has granted Ford any of her preposterous conditions for testifying: She will take questions from the Committee, but not from outside lawyers, who might not be as gentle as politicians with one eye on the polls.\nOnly one camera can be in the room.\nKavanaugh must testify first, a grotesque inversion of our bedrock principle that an accused has the right to confront his accuser\u2019s charges.\nHe can\u2019t be in the room with her, apparently because she\u2019s still traumatized and may start experiencing flashbacks.\nSo much for \u201cI am woman, hear me roar.\u201d\nGrassley shouldn\u2019t cave on these conditions.\nThey all comprise the old tactic of serially escalating demands that cannot be satisfied in order to compel your enemy to give in.\nThat Grassley and the Republicans would even participate in this absurd show trial is testimony to how deeply the progressive ideological narrative has burrowed into our social and political life.\nIf Ford actually testifies on Thursday, or Ramirez is granted the same concession, nothing material will be gained.\nHer accusation will not be proved true or false.\nWe will learn nothing about Kavanaugh that makes him any less eminently qualified for the Supreme Court, nothing that can add to the thousands of pages of documents already presented to the Committee, or the hundreds of hours of the judge\u2019s testimony before rabid partisans and office-seekers.\nBut vetting Kavanaugh\u2019s qualifications isn\u2019t the point.\nThe point is to delay confirmation by slandering Kavanaugh and baiting the Republicans into appearing to abuse victims of sexual assault.\nWhy?\nFacing his likely confirmation, the Dems, egged on by the mainstream media\u2013\u2013especially The New Yorker, which published a story too badly sourced even for The New York Times\u2013\u2013 are desperately attempting to obstruct and delay the process until after the midterm elections, when they hope they will retake the Senate and thus stop any more Constitutionalist judges from being confirmed to the Court for the rest of Trump\u2019s term.\nThe Democrats have stooped so low with these smears because they know the stakes.\nThe courts and especially the Supreme Court have been critical to the progressives\u2019 program since Woodrow Wilson.\nThe biggest obstacle to the progressive dream of government controlled and managed by a technocratic oligarchy has been the Constitution.\nIts divided and balanced powers were designed precisely to rein in overreaching ambition and concentrations of power.\nHence the Constitutional order must be subverted by the Supreme Court and its unaccountable justices enjoying lifelong tenure.\nBut if Kavanaugh is confirmed, there will be five reliably Constitutionalist justices on the bench, who are unlikely to tolerate judicial usurpation of Congress\u2019s law-making powers.\nThat\u2019s why this current nomination is a hill the Dems are willing to beclown themselves on.\nGiven how obviously partisan and hypocritical this ploy is\u2013\u2013doesn\u2019t Keith Ellison\u2019s accuser deserve to be heard and believed too?\n\u2013\u2013why has Grassley so far allowed himself to be played by the Dems?\nBecause Republicans fear the backlash from all those women voters who presumably agree with the fundamentalist feminists, and insist that every accusation of sexual assault, no matter how much it\u2019s unsupported by corroborating evidence or even plausibility, must be believed.\nThis contention itself is an expression of the radical feminist narrative of innate male feral sexuality that makes them sexual predators.\nThe irony is that today\u2019s feminists have been willing to sacrifice the earlier narrative of female power and agency that had been stifled by traditional views of the sexes and their capabilities.\nInstead, now women are Victorian hothouse flowers too delicate to make their way through their lives without the paternal federal government protecting them with its coercive power.\nWomen have exchanged one form of dependence, and one double standard for another.\nThe Dems are using Ford and Ramirez as part of the Democrats\u2019 transparently dishonest delaying tactics because they know that most Republicans have accepted this duplicitous feminist narrative and fear challenging it.\nEspecially after the recent spate of sexual assault charges\u2013\u2013many of them true, some false, others contested\u2013\u2013 politicians consider bucking the narrative to be as politically suicidal as proposing to reform Social Security and Medicare.\nIt\u2019s the new third rail of American politics, one that transcends party affiliation.\nHence the widespread virtue-signaling on the part even of conservative writers who preface their comments about Ford and Ramirez with prologues full of truisms about how horrible sexual assault is, how its self-proclaimed victims \u201cmust be heard,\u201d and how churlish and sexist it is to question the truth of any charge.\nGrown-ups know all that and don\u2019t have to be reminded every time the subject arises.\nThe Dems know that most Republicans come to this conflict with the huge disadvantage that results from accepting your opponent\u2019s dubious ideology and dishonest narrative.\nThe progressive party can dare the Republicans to ignore the endless specious demands, stop the show-trial, and proceed to a vote on Kavanaugh, because they know the Republicans, fearful of the \u201coptics,\u201d will cave.\nThey know that the eleven male Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee dread the #MeToo movement casting them as knuckle-dragging Neanderthal sexists who want to \u201csilence\u201d the accuser with their \u201ccavalier treatment of a sexual assault survivor,\u201d as one Ford lawyer has said.\nRepublicans still don\u2019t get that no amount of appeasement will stop the left from demonizing them anyway.\nJust ask Boy Scout Mitt Romney, who was savaged for his innocuous \u201cbinders full of women.\u201d\nAnd don\u2019t forget, the old sorta, kinda moderate Democrats like Feinstein and Chuck Schumer, who now have joined the crowd of trendoid socialists armed with torches and pitch-forks, will go along because they\u2019re frightened of their party\u2019s increasingly rabid left-wing base.\nWhat can we do to end these confirmation circuses?\nJust stop holding them.\nThere\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that says the Senate\u2019s power to give \u201cadvice and consent\u201d to the president regarding his nominee must entail days of televised hearings replete with caterwauling protestors and grandstanding Senators who\u2019ve already made-up their minds.\nInvite written questions from the Senate, then schedule one day for the nominee to respond.\nDon\u2019t put it on television, but make public a written transcript.\nRemove the television cameras, and attention-craving, politically ambitious Senators will be gone like a cool breeze.\nFor now, Grassley needs to end this farce if Ford doesn\u2019t show up on Thursday or continues to negotiate for more delays and concessions.\nNo more concessions.\nNo more delays.\nNo more ceding control of the process to Democrat Party lawyers.\nDon\u2019t give Ramirez the time of day.\nHold the vote no later than Thursday, or Friday if Ford does show up.\nMake Senators go on the record with their votes, and hold them to account in November.\nPut to the test the Dems\u2019 claims that a critical mass of women, many of them with sons they don\u2019t want falsely accused, believes the fundamentalist feminist narrative and will vote accordingly.\nTo borrow Churchill\u2019s definition of appeasement, stop feeding the alligator in the hopes that you will be eaten

the hatches for a hearing today to receive oral evidence from the first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, 51, who claims Kavanaugh, 53, tried to rape her decades ago when he was a high school student.\nThe third accuser is Julie Swetnick, a 55-year-old certified systems engineer, who on Wednesday claimed that in the early 1980s Kavanaugh and others spiked the drinks of young women at high school parties with intoxicants to clear the way for them to be gang-raped.\nIncredibly, Swetnick said in a sworn statement that she witnessed gang rapes at these parties but kept on attending them anyway.\nIt gets weirder.\nKavanaugh was a \u201cmean drunk,\u201d she stated.\nHe drank excessively at these parties and would grind against girls and try to take their clothing of, she said.\nSwetnick claimed to have been gang-raped at one of these parties in 1982 as a result of consuming a spiked drink that contained \u201cQuaaludes or something similar.\u201d Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge were present at the party at which she was raped, she states, but she doesn\u2019t accuse them of participating in it.\nIn response, Kavanaugh labeled Swetnick's salacious allegations \"ridiculous and from the Twilight Zone.\"\n\"I don't know who this is and this never happened,\" the judicial nominee added.\nA CNBC summary describes Swetnick:\nA 1980 graduate of Gaithersburg High School in Maryland, she said she has held multiple clearances for work done at the Treasury Department, U.S. Mint, IRS, State Department and Justice Department, among other government agencies.\nSwetnick says in her affidavit that she saw Kavanaugh in the early 1980s \"drink excessively at many\" house parties in suburban Maryland.\nAt the time, Kavanaugh and Judge were students at Georgetown Prep, a private Catholic all-boys school.\nShe said Kavanaugh and Judge engaged in \"abusive and physically aggressive behavior toward girls,\" which \"included the fondling and groping of girls without their consent\" and \"not taking 'No' for an answer.\"\nPredictably, all 10 Democrat members of the Judiciary Committee urged President Trump to either \"immediately withdraw the nomination or order an FBI investigation into all the allegations.\"\nThere is no indication so far that the president will oblige them.\nTo no one\u2019s surprise, Trump\u2019s legal tormentor, Stormy Daniels attorney Michael Avenatti, whom Tucker Carlson has dubbed \u201ccreepy porn lawyer,\u201d is representing Swetnick.\n\"There should be an immediate investigation\" of Swetnick\u2019s dramatic allegations, Avenatti said on MSNBC, \"and there should be no rush to confirm him to the U.S. Supreme Court.\"\nThe president slammed Avenatti.\n\u201cAvenatti is a third rate lawyer who is good at making false accusations, like he did on me and like he is now doing on Judge Brett Kavanaugh[,]\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\u201cHe is just looking for attention and doesn\u2019t want people to look at his past record and relationships - a total low-life!\u201d\nHe rejected Swetnick\u2019s allegations as \u201canother beauty\u201d and described Avenatti as a \u201ccon artist.\u201d\n\u201cAll of a sudden, the hearings are over, and the rumors start coming out,\u201d Trump said.\n\u201cAnd then you this other con artist, Avenatti, come out with another beauty today.\"\nA fourth accuser popped up yesterday, Politico reports.\nAccording to an interview transcript released Wednesday night by the Senate Judiciary Committee:\nAn anonymous woman wrote to Sen. Cory Gardner\u2019s (R-Colo.) office on Sept. 22 alleging that the Supreme Court nominee shoved another woman \u201cup against the wall very aggressively and sexually\u201d in 1998 after leaving a bar where both had been drinking, the transcript states.\nKavanaugh denied any involvement in the events alleged in that complaint, which was first reported by NBC.\nDepending on how you do the counting, there may even be a fifth and sixth accusation against Kavanaugh.\nThe newspaper account continues:\nThe transcript of Kavanaugh's Tuesday interview also cited another anonymous claim of sexual misconduct involving Kavanaugh, dating back to 1985 and sent to the office of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), which the judge also flatly denied to investigators.\nAnd GOP investigators said late Wednesday they received an additional anonymous claim of rape passed along by Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.).\nAccuser number two is Deborah Ramirez, 53, who went public with her claims in a New Yorker magazine article Sunday.\nRamirez alleges she was assaulted by Kavanaugh at a drunken party decades ago at Yale College.\nShe claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and brushed his genitals against her.\nIf Kavanaugh isn\u2019t on the bench Monday, the Supreme Court will be shorthanded as it begins hearing cases in its new term.\nIt normally has a complement of nine justices but with Anthony Kennedy\u2019s retirement July 31, which cleared the way for Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, there have been only eight justices.\nRoughly speaking there is a 4-to-4 liberal to conservative ideological split on the court.\nDemocrats are trying to drag the confirmation process into the next Congress where they may seize control from Republicans.\nElection Day is November 6.\nThe GOP currently controls the Senate, which has the final say on judicial nominations, by an uncomfortably close margin of 51 to 49.\nThe proceedings Thursday are supposed to get underway at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time.\nCommittee Republicans considered the political optics and didn\u2019t relish the prospect of their all-male team of 11 senators questioning a woman so they hired sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell of Maricopa County, Arizona, to ask the questions at what promises to be a highly-watched hearing.\nDemocrats predictably freaked out at the decision to have a woman lead the questioning since their primary objective here is to embarrass and discredit Kavanaugh and other Republicans, not get at the truth.\n\u201cIt is going against everything I\u2019ve seen for 44 years,\" huffed committee member Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.).\n\"They\u2019re not following normal procedure.\"\nAs expected, at today\u2019s hearing Kavanaugh will firmly rebut the increasingly outrageous claims being leveled at him.\nAccording to prepared testimony provided to The Hill newspaper, he will say:\nI categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford.\nI never had any sexual or physical encounter of any kind with Dr. Ford.\nI am not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time.\nBut I have never done that to her or to anyone.\nKavanaugh added: \"I am innocent of this charge.\"\nNot surprisingly Ford\u2019s prepared testimony also found its way to reporters.\n\u201cI am here today not because I want to be,\u201d Ford says in her opening statement.\n\u201cI am terrified.\nI am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school.\u201d\nShe describes the nominee as \u201cBrett Kavanaugh, the boy who sexually assaulted me,\u201d and claims \u201cBrett\u2019s assault on me drastically altered my life,\u201d but at the same time acknowledges \u201cBrett did not rape me.\u201d\nGiven that Kavanaugh has already passed six incredibly intrusive FBI investigations, odds are Ford is lying or suffering from some kind of psychological disorder such as false memory syndrome.\nMany commentators have drawn parallels between Ford and Anita Hill, who in 1991 accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual improprieties.\nBoth women are college professors.\nBoth claim to have reluctantly been drawn into confirmation battles.\nFord claims to be a victim of attempted rape; Hill claims to have been a victim of sexual harassment in the workplace.\nOnly left-wingers and feminists like Maureen Dowd still believe Hill, now an utterly undistinguished politically correct scholar who discredited herself by \u2013among other things\u2014 following her then-boss Thomas as his subordinate when he switched jobs.\nAn abused person wouldn\u2019t do that.\nBut all the lies about Thomas at what he described as a \u201chigh-tech lynching for uppity blacks\u201d had an effect.\nIn the end, the Senate barely approved his nomination 52 to 48 on October 15, 1991.\nWith all the mud Democrats have been slinging at Kavanaugh, he would be thrilled to be approved by a margin as wide as 52 to 48.\nConservatives need to remember that the purpose of the Left\u2019s frenzied, demagogic assault is to damage the nominee, and by extension, the president who nominated him.\nIf they can derail Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, that is an added bonus.\nThe Left\u2019s attacks on Kavanaugh in the #MeToo era are working, a USA Today article suggests:\nDisapproval for Kavanaugh \u2026 is at an unprecedented level for a Supreme Court nominee amid the allegations against him, according to a new USA TODAY/Ipsos Public Affairs Poll.\nThose surveyed said by 40 percent to 31 percent that the Senate shouldn't vote to approve his nomination, the first time a plurality of Americans have opposed a Supreme Court nominee since polling on the issue began.\nThe case against confirming Kavanaugh may be somewhere between weak and non-existent, but the constant repetition of the unsupported allegations in the Trump-hating media is clearly taking its toll on the nominee.\nThat said, the Senate Judiciary Committee is tentatively scheduled to vote on the nomination Friday at 9:30 a.m.\n\"If we're ready to vote, we will vote,\u201d Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) tweeted Tuesday at 6:46 p.m. \u201cIf we aren't ready, we won't.\u201d\nObviously, a lot is riding on the confirmation.\n\u201cWe're watching a period where what we have to understand is this is about raw power,\" former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said Tuesday.\n\"And if the Left can stop Kavanaugh we will not get another conservative justice in our lifetime on the Supreme Court.\"\nPresident Trump quoted the nation\u2019s most prominent conservative radio host as he urged GOP senators to get onboard Tuesday:\n\u201cRush Limbaugh to Republicans: \u2018You can kiss the MIDTERMS goodbye if you don\u2019t get highly qualified Kavanaugh approved.\u2019\u201d\nTrump is right.\n", ["Repetition", "Doubt", "Appeal_to_fear-prejudice", "Loaded_Language", "Whataboutism,Straw_Men,Red_Herring", "Causal_Oversimplification",

arguably the most courageous prelate in the Church today\u2014Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2.\nThe former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States has, as they say, doubled down.\nFar from backing-away and making excuses for his early actions, as we\u2019ve all become so accustomed to seeing in these rare cases where a hierarch breaks ranks, Archbishop Vigan\u00f2 is digging in with a 4-page bombshell that restates his initial accusations of abuse cover-up against Francis and other powerful members of the hierarchy, and even concludes with a suggestion that Francis is beginning to act as a \u201csubstitute of our Lord.\u201d\nRead the Archbishop\u2019s words for yourselves and note well the ring of truth that resonates in every sentence.\nThis is clearly the testimony of an honest man who has only the good of the Church in his heart\u2014a modern-day Athanasius standing against something so much worse than Liberius.\nFriends, let us pray for Archbishop Vigan\u00f2.\nHe is standing alone now, and not only against the most dangerous pontificate in history, but also the forces of hell itself\u2014forces which will do all in their power to silence this voice crying in the wilderness.\nMake no mistake about this: Archbishop Vigan\u00f2 is fighting for the very survival of the human element of the Catholic Church.\nHe is standing against corrupt men in high places who cannot be trusted to do what is best for souls, for the Catholic faithful or indeed for Holy Mother Church herself.\nThe enemy is not only at the gates but has now made their way to the thrones of power and the seats of the Apostles.\nGod help us.\nIt goes without saying that we here at The Remnant not only stand with Vigan\u00f2 but we thank God for him every day, we pray the Rosary for him every day, and wish him every blessing and heavenly consolation as he undergoes this passion for the sake of the Master he serves so well.\nGod bless you, Your Excellency, and Mary keep you.\nWe are with you!\nMJM\n_________________________________\nTit.\nArchbishop of Ulpiana\nApostolic Nuncio\nScio Cui credidi\n(2 Tim 1:12)\nBefore starting my writing, I would first of all like to give thanks and glory to God the Father for every situation and trial that He has prepared and will prepare for me during my life.\nAs a priest and bishop of the holy Church, spouse of Christ, I am called like every baptized person to bear witness to the truth.\nBy the gift of the Spirit who sustains me with joy on the path that I am called to travel, I intend to do so until the end of my days.\nOur only Lord has addressed also to me the invitation, \u201cFollow me!\u201d, and I intend to follow him with the help of his grace until the end of my days.\n\u201cAs long as I have life, I will sing to the Lord,\nI will sing praise to my God while I have being.\nMay my song be pleasing to him;\nFor I rejoice in the Lord.\u201d\n(Psalm 103:33-34)\n*****\nIt has been a month since I offered my testimony, solely for the good of the Church, regarding what occurred at the audience with Pope Francis on June 23, 2013 and regarding certain matters I was given to know in the assignments entrusted to me at the Secretariat of State and in Washington, in relation to those who bear responsibility for covering up the crimes committed by the former archbishop of that capital.\nMy decision to reveal those grave facts was for me the most painful and serious decision that I have ever made in my life.\nI made it after long reflection and prayer, during months of profound suffering and anguish, during a crescendo of continual news of terrible events, with thousands of innocent victims destroyed and the vocations and lives of young priests and religious disturbed.\nThe silence of the pastors who could have provided a remedy and prevented new victims became increasingly indefensible, a devastating crime for the Church.\nWell aware of the enormous consequences that my testimony could have, because what I was about to reveal involved the successor of Peter himself, I nonetheless chose to speak in order to protect the Church, and I declare with a clear conscience before God that my testimony is true.\nChrist died for the Church, and Peter, Servus servorum Dei, is the first one called to serve the spouse of Christ.\nCertainly, some of the facts that I was to reveal were covered by the pontifical secret that I had promised to observe and that I had faithfully observed from the beginning of my service to the Holy See.\nBut the purpose of any secret, including the pontifical secret, is to protect the Church from her enemies, not to cover up and become complicit in crimes committed by some of her members.\nI was a witness, not by my choice, of shocking facts and, as the Catechism of the Catholic Church states (par.\n2491), the seal of secrecy is not binding when very grave harm can be avoided only by divulging the truth.\nOnly the seal of confession could have justified my silence.\nNeither the pope, nor any of the cardinals in Rome have denied the facts I asserted in my testimony.\n\u201cQui tacet consentit\u201d surely applies here, for if they deny my testimony, they have only to say so, and provide documentation to support that denial.\nHow can one avoid concluding that the reason they do not provide the documentation is that they know it confirms my testimony?\nThe center of my testimony was that since at least June 23, 2013, the pope knew from me how perverse and evil McCarrick was in his intentions and actions, and instead of taking the measures that every good pastor would have taken, the pope made McCarrick one of his principal agents in governing the Church, in regard to the United States, the Curia, and even China, as we are seeing these days with great concern and anxiety for that martyr Church.\nNow, the pope\u2019s reply to my testimony was: \u201cI will not say a word!\u201d But then, contradicting himself, he has compared his silence to that of Jesus in Nazareth and before Pilate, and compared me to the great accuser, Satan, who sows scandal and division in the Church \u2014 though without ever uttering my name.\nIf he had said: \u201cVigan\u00f2 lied,\u201d he would have challenged my credibility while trying to affirm his own.\nIn so doing he would have intensified the demand of the people of God and the world for the documentation needed to determine who has told the truth.\nInstead, he put in place a subtle slander against me \u2014 slander being an offense he has often compared to the gravity of murder.\nIndeed, he did it repeatedly, in the context of the celebration of the most Holy Sacrament, the Eucharist, where he runs no risk of being challenged by journalists.\nWhen he did speak to journalists, he asked them to exercise their professional maturity and draw their own conclusions.\nBut how can journalists discover and know the truth if those directly involved with a matter refuse to answer any questions or to release any documents?\nThe pope\u2019s unwillingness to respond to my charges and his deafness to the appeals by the faithful for accountability are hardly consistent with his calls for transparency and bridge building.\nMoreover, the pope\u2019s cover-up of McCarrick was clearly not an isolated mistake.\nMany more instances have recently been documented in the press, showing that Pope Francis has defended homosexual clergy who committed serious sexual abuses against minors or adults.\nThese include his role in the case of Fr.\nJulio Grassi in Buenos Aires, his reinstatement of Fr.\nMauro Inzoli after Pope Benedict had removed him from ministry (until he went to prison, at which point Pope Francis laicized him), and his halting of the investigation of sex abuse allegations against Cardinal Cormac Murphy O\u2019Connor.\nIn the meantime, a delegation of the USCCB, headed by its president Cardinal DiNardo, went to Rome asking for a Vatican investigation into McCarrick.\nCardinal DiNardo and the other prelates should tell the Church in America and in the world: did the pope refuse to carry out a Vatican investigation into McCarrick\u2019s crimes and of those responsible for covering them up?\nThe faithful deserve to know.\nI would like to make a special appeal to Cardinal Ouellet, because as nuncio I always worked in great harmony with him, and I have always had great esteem and affection towards him.\nHe will remember when, at the end of my mission in Washington, he received me at his apartment in Rome in the evening for a long conversation.\nAt the beginning of Pope Francis\u2019 pontificate, he had maintained his dignity, as he had shown with courage when he was Archbishop of Qu\u00e9bec.\nLater, however, when his work as prefect of the Congregation for Bishops was being undermined because recommendations for episcopal appointments were being passed directly to Pope Francis by two homosexual \u201cfriends\u201d of his dicastery, bypassing the Cardinal, he gave up.\nHis long article in L\u2019Osservatore Romano, in which he came out in favor of the more controversial aspects of Amoris Laetitia, represents his surrender.\nYour Eminence, before I left for Washington, you were the one who told me of Pope Benedict\u2019s sanctions on McCarrick.\nYou have at your complete disposal key documents incriminating McCarrick and many in the curia for their cover-ups.\nYour Eminence, I urge you to bear witness to the truth.\n*****\nFinally, I wish to encourage you, dear faithful, my brothers and sisters in Christ: never be despondent!\nMake your own the act of faith and complete confidence in Christ Jesus, our Savior, of Saint Paul in his second Letter to Timothy, Scio cui credidi, which I choose as my episcopal motto.\nThis is a time of repentance, of conversion, of prayers, of grace, to prepare the Church, the bride of the Lamb, ready to fight and win with Mary the battle against the old dragon.\n", ["Doubt", "Appeal_to_fear-prejudice", "Exaggeration,Minimisation", "Loaded_Language", "Causal_Oversimplification", "Name_Calling,Labeling", "Flag-Waving"]], ["MSM Using Kavanaugh Sex Scandal to Distract You From Real Reason He Shouldn\u2019t Be Confirmed\nIn July, President Donald Trump nominated D.C.\nCircuit Court of Appeals Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the

through your personal life \u2014 without a warrant.\nOn multiple occasions, Kavanaugh has been the lone voice when it comes supporting the state\u2019s rights to warrantlessly spy on its citizens.\nAs Reason points out, in 2010 he dissented from the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision not to rehear a case in which a three-judge panel had ruled that police violated a suspected drug dealer\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights when they tracked his movements for a month by attaching a GPS device to his car without a warrant.\nKavanaugh claimed that putting a GPS tracking device on a person\u2019s car without first obtaining a warrant was just fine because it didn\u2019t constitute a \u201csearch\u201d as defined by the Fourth Amendment.\nTo Kavanaugh, bypassing the courts and tracking an individual without their consent is \u201cconstitutional.\u201d In this line of thinking, the Fourth Amendment is not violated even if police trespass on someone\u2019s physical property, or track someone\u2019s cell phone.\nLuckily, he was the only judge on the panel to think this.\nIn June, the Supreme Court ruled specifically on this case noting that collecting such information actually does constitute a search and therefore requires a warrant.\nBut it gets worse.\nIn 2015, Kavanaugh issued a statement strongly defending the NSA\u2019s phone metadata collection program, arguing that it is \u201centirely consistent with the Fourth Amendment.\u201d To Kavanaugh, sweeping programs that collect information from innocent citizens\u2019 phones are not in conflict with having the right to be free from unlawful search and seizure.\nSeriously.\nAccording to Kavanaugh, the Fourth Amendment allows for searches \u201cwithout individualized suspicion\u201d when the government demonstrates a \u201cspecial need\u201d that \u201coutweighs the intrusion on individual liberty.\u201d\nExactly what this \u201cspecial need\u201d is that can constitute a Gestapo like police state surveilling its own citizens is a moving target that has already been proven to be abused over and over again.\n\u201cThe sacrifice of our personal liberty for security is and will forever be a false choice,\u201d Senator Rand Paul said of Kavanaugh\u2019s views on the disposable nature of the constitution.\nKavanaugh \u201chas no qualms about applying decades-old case law to the digital age, and he has endorsed the idea of a \u201ccounterterrorism exception\u201d to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement,\u201d said Liza Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center for Justice\u2019s Liberty and National Security Program.\nWhile the left is calling for Kavanaugh to be executed over the sex abuse allegations and the right is attacking the alleged victims, others in Congress who see through the facade and media distraction are trying to draw attention to the fact that Kavanaugh is a champion of the police and surveillance state and an enemy to privacy.\nRepresentative Justin Amash does not have a vote on whether or not Kavanaugh will be appointed.\nHowever, this hasn\u2019t prevented him from becoming the only Republican to speak out against the real reasons he should not be appointed to Supreme Court.\n\u201cPrivacy advocates must fight,\u201d Amash tweeted.\n\u201cThere are many potential nominees with a conservative record on abortion, guns, and regulations.\nThe only question is will the Senate confirm one who is really bad on the #4thAmendment, when so much is at stake in upcoming digital privacy battles.\u201d\nIndeed, as technology increases, so does the desire of the state to use it to spy on us.\nThe cases headed to the supreme court in the future over what constitutes an unconstitutional search will undoubtedly be vast in number and detrimental in deciding how much freedom and privacy Americans get to keep.\nAs for if Kavanaugh gets appointed, Amash has some harsh words to those who are blindly supporting him based on party lines:\n\u201cWhen Kavanaugh is on the Supreme Court, undermining our #4thAmendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures, it will be too late for others to join me.\u201d\nBelow is a video taken at the Mises Institute of Judge Napolitano explaining the implications of this enemy of the Fourth Amendment on the Supreme Court.\nJudge Andrew #Napolitano on Brett #Kavanaugh and the #PatriotAct At Mises University, Judge Andrew Napolitano breaks down some of the troubling parts of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's legal career.\nhttps://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/cadc/15-5307/15-5307-2015-11-20.htmlLong story short, #Kavanaugh is not a friend to civil liberties or the Constitution.\nHe helped to uphold the UnConstitutional Patriot Act which of course paved the way for the Indefinte Detention provisions of the NDAA.\nAuburn, Alabama;

committee Republicans didn\u2019t relish the prospect of their all-male team of 11 senators questioning a woman so they hired sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell of Maricopa County, Arizona, to examine Ford.\nOpinions differ widely on how Mitchell performed.\nShe tiptoed around the alleged sexual assault itself, instead focusing on process-related questions, presumably in an effort to show undecided senators how Ford and her handlers have been unfairly manipulating the process.\nIn much of her testimony, Ford came across as presentable and seemingly credible, though vague and sometimes evasive, her ridiculous overall story notwithstanding.\nFord did well enough that during the break between her testimony and Kavanaugh\u2019s, commentators on Fox News such as Brit Hume and Andrew Napolitano were openly musing about the nominee withdrawing, opinions that were sharply reversed after the nominee completed his testimony hours later.\nIt\u2019s not that Mitchell did a bad job creating an inventory of the irregularities in the process and of the odd behavior of Ford and her lawyers.\nShe could do little else.\nShe had many restrictions placed upon her and was only allowed to question Ford for minutes at a time before surrendering the floor to the next committee Democrat.\nAs commentator Sean Davis tweeted:\n\u201cHard to do much else when the witness conveniently has no corroborating evidence, no memory of any verifiable facts of what happened, and everyone she says was present at the alleged incident--even her best friend--has denied it.\u201d\nNonetheless, Mitchell\u2019s questioning came across at times as perfunctory, leading many observers to conclude that Republicans threw away a valuable opportunity by using her as a stand-in.\nShe failed to lay a glove on a witness whose implausible, internally contradictory story cried out for vigorous cross-examination.\nIn the end the too-deferential, easygoing Mitchell failed to provide much, if anything, in the way of evidence against Ford or in favor of Kavanaugh.\nWhether her work will bring over fence-sitting senators to Kavanaugh\u2019s side remains to be seen.\nLike other Democrats, Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii tried to help Ford, lobbing her softballs.\nAfter saying she thought she knew what Mitchell was trying to get at in her questions, the senator said, \u201cso I'll just ask you very plainly, Dr. Ford, is there a political motivation for your coming forward with your account of the assault by Brett Kavanaugh?\u201d\n\u201cNo, and I'd like to reiterate that again, I was trying to get the information to you while there was still a list of other what looked like equally-qualified candidates,\u201d Ford replied.\nWhen Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) asked Ford \u201cwith what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?\u201d Ford replied, \u201cone hundred percent.\u201d\nStrangely, Ford has a bad long-term memory and a bad short-term memory.\nShe doesn\u2019t know when or where the alleged incident took place, yet she is \u201cone hundred percent\u201d certain it was Kavanaugh who attacked her.\nAt the outset of the hearing, Grassley provided an overview of what Kavanaugh had gone through \u2013including the Democrats\u2019 sordid behavior\u2014 since President Trump announced the judge\u2019s nomination on July 9.\nAs part of the confirmation process, Kavanaugh endured his sixth background investigation since 1993.\n\u201cNowhere in any of these six FBI reports, which committee investigators have reviewed on a bipartisan basis, was there a whiff of any issue \u2013 any issue at all related in any way to inappropriate sexual behavior,\u201d Grassley said.\nFord shared her allegations in a letter to the committee\u2019s ranking member, Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), in the summer.\nThe letter remained secret from July 30 through until September 13 when he first learned about it, the chairman said.\nInstead of sharing the letter with the committee, Feinstein did nothing.\nBefore the hearing, Kavanaugh met privately with 65 senators, including Feinstein, who didn\u2019t ask him about the allegations when she met with him in August.\nThe committee held a four-day public hearing from September 4 to September 7 during which Kavanaugh testified for more than 32 hours in public.\nFeinstein didn\u2019t attend it, Grassley said.\nKavanaugh answered almost 1,300 written questions senators submitted after the hearing.\nThat is \u201cmore than all prior Supreme Court nominees,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThroughout this period, we did not know about the ranking member's secret evidence.\nThen, only at an 11th hour, on the eve of Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation vote, did the ranking member refer the allegations to the FBI.\nAnd then, sadly, the allegations were leaked to the press.\u201d\n\u201cEvery step of the way the Democratic side refused to participate in what should have been a bipartisan investigation,\u201d Grassley said.\nAfter Ford\u2019s identity became public, Grassley\u2019s staff \u201ccontacted all the individuals she said attended the 1982 party described in the Washington Post article,\u201d he said.\nKavanaugh \u201cimmediately submitted to an interview under penalty of felony for any knowingly false statements.\nHe denied the allegations categorically.\u201d\n\u201cDemocratic staff was invited to participate and could have asked any questions they wanted to, but they declined.\nWhich leads me then to wonder: If they're really concerned with going to the truth, why wouldn't you want to talk to the accused?\u201d\nGrassley said his staff contacted the other individuals who allegedly attended the party at which the conduct Ford complained of allegedly took place: Mark Judge, Patrick Smyth, and Leland Keyser.\n\u201cAll three submitted statements to the Senate under \u2013 under penalty of felony, denying any knowledge of the events described by Dr. Ford.\nDr. Ford's lifelong friend, Dr. \u2013 Miss Keyser, stated she doesn't know Judge Kavanaugh and doesn't recall ever attending a party with him.\u201d\nGrassley said his staff repeatedly sought to interview Ford over the past 11 days, \u201ceven volunteering to fly to California to take her testimony, but her attorneys refused to prevent \u2013 present her allegations to Congress.\u201d\n\u201cConsistent with their stated desires to obstruct Kavanaugh's nomination\u201d by any means possible, \u201cpushed for FBI investigations into the allegations.\u201d\n\u201cWe've been trying to investigate other allegations,\u201d Grassley said.\n\u201cAt this time, we have not had cooperation from attorneys representing other clients, and they have made no attempt to substantiate their claims.\u201d\nAttorneys for new Kavanaugh accusers Deborah Ramirez and Julie Swetnick have been approached by committee staff on eight and six occasions, respectively, Grassley said.\n\u201cNeither attorney has made their clients available for interview.\nThe committee can't do an investigation if attorneys are stonewalling.\u201d\nWith his performance at the hearing, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who is frequently a target of conservatives for going rogue on important issues, partly redeemed himself in the eyes of many conservatives.\nWhile questioning Kavanaugh, Graham lambasted the confirmation process the judge has been put through, calling it \u201cthe most unethical sham since I've been in politics.\u201d\nLashing out at Democrats, Graham said, \u201cIf you wanted an FBI investigation, you could have come to us.\nWhat you want to do is destroy this guy's life, hold this seat open and hope you win in 2020.\u201d\n\u201cBoy, you all want power,\u201d he shouted.\n\u201cGod, I hope you never get it.\nI hope the American people can see through this sham.\u201d\nGraham warned fellow GOPers about voting against the nomination.\n\u201cTo my Republican colleagues, if you vote no, you're legitimizing the most despicable thing I have seen in my time in politics.\nYou want this seat?\nI hope you never get it.\u201d\nSen.

against Riyadh, as many in Congress and elsewhere have urged.\nCritics questioned whether the Saudi rulers, who preside over an authoritarian regime that allows little opposition, can be relied on to conduct a credible probe into Khashoggi\u2019s fate \u2014 especially without decisive pressure from their close ally, the Trump administration.\nSaudi leaders for two weeks denied knowing anything

after telling jokes that were criticized as racist and homophobic during his performance at cultureSHOCK: Reclaim, an event held by Columbia Asian American Alliance on Friday night.\nPatel, 32, was the first Indian-American writer for SNL, and has since been nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing.\nPatel has previously performed on Late Night with Seth Meyers and opened for comedians such as Chris Rock.\nDuring the event, Patel\u2019s performance featured commentary on his experience living in a diverse area of New York City\u2014including a joke about a gay, black man in his neighborhood\u2014which AAA officials deemed inappropriate.\nPatel joked that being gay cannot be a choice because \u201cno one looks in the mirror and thinks, \u2018this black thing is too easy, let me just add another thing to it.\u2019\u201d\nAbout 30 minutes into Patel\u2019s set, members of AAA interrupted the performance, denounced his jokes about racial identities and sexual orientation, and provided him with a few moments for closing remarks.\nCompared to his other jokes, ones specifically targeting sexual orientation audibly receive less laughter from the crowd.\nPatel pushed back on the officials\u2019 remarks, and said that while he stood in solidarity with Asian American identities, none of his remarks were offensive, and he was exposing the audience to ideas that would be found \u201cin the real world.\u201d Before he could finish, Patel\u2019s microphone was cut from off-stage, and he proceeded to leave.\ncultureSHOCK, an annual charity showcase featuring a fashion show, productions by various student groups and a famous performer, aims to provide a platform for Asian American artistic expression and breakthrough harmful stereotypes.\nNeither Patel and nor AAA could immediately be reached for comment.\nAdam Warren, CC \u201822, was in the audience Friday night.\nWarren said that AAA made the right decision to remove Patel from the stage due to the nature of his jokes, which contradicted the sensitive nature of the event itself.\n\u201cThe message they were trying to send with the event was opposite to the jokes he was making, and using people\u2019s ethnicity as the crux of his jokes could be funny but still offensive...He definitely wasn\u2019t the most crass comedian I\u2019ve ever heard but for the event it was inappropriate,\u201d Warren said.\nHowever, audience member Elle Ferguson, BC \u201822, said that while comedians can push the boundaries of social culture, she had heard similar jokes before and did not find them offensive.\n\u201cWhile what some of the things that he said might have been a bit provoking to some of the audience, as someone who watches comedy a lot, none of them were jokes that I hadn\u2019t heard before and none of them were jokes that elicited such a response in my experience,\u201d Ferguson said.\n\u201c[AAA] should have talked to him beforehand especially because comedy is known for being ground-breaking and for pushing boundaries.\u201d\nFor Sofia Jao, BC \u201822, problems with the performance resided not in the set, but with Patel\u2019s closing remarks.\n\u201cI really dislike when people who are older say that our generation needs to be exposed to the real world.\nObviously the world is not a safe space but just accepting that it\u2019s not and continuing to

fake documents regarding Julian Assange, and channel them straight to MI6 mouthpiece Luke Harding of the Guardian.\nAmazingly, more Ecuadorean Government documents have just been discovered for the Guardian, this time spy agency reports detailing visits of Paul Manafort and unspecified \u201cRussians\u201d to the Embassy.\nBy a wonderful coincidence of timing, this is the day after Mueller announced that Manafort\u2019s plea deal was over.\nThe problem with this latest fabrication is that Moreno had already released the visitor logs to the Mueller inquiry.\nNeither Manafort nor these \u201cRussians\u201d are in the visitor logs.\nThis is impossible.\nThe visitor logs were not kept by Wikileaks, but by the very strict Ecuadorean security.\nNobody was ever admitted without being entered in the logs.\nThe procedure was very thorough.\nTo go in, you had to submit your passport (no other type of document was accepted).\nA copy of your passport was taken and the passport details entered into the log.\nYour passport, along with your mobile phone and any other electronic equipment, was retained until you left, along with your bag and coat.\nI feature in the logs every time I visited.\nThere were no exceptions.\nFor an exception to be made for Manafort and the \u201cRussians\u201d would have had to be a decision of the Government of Ecuador, not of Wikileaks, and that would be so exceptional the reason for it would surely have been noted in the now leaked supposed Ecuadorean \u201cintelligence report\u201d of the visits.\nWhat possible motive would the Ecuadorean government have for facilitating secret unrecorded visits by Paul Manafort?\nFurthermore it is impossible that the intelligence agency \u2013 who were in charge of the security \u2013 would not know the identity of these alleged \u201cRussians\u201d.\nPreviously Harding and the Guardian have published documents faked by the Moreno government regarding a diplomatic appointment to Russia for Assange of which he had no knowledge.\nNow they follow this up with more documents aimed to provide fictitious evidence to bolster Mueller\u2019s pathetically failed attempt to substantiate the story that Russia deprived Hillary of the Presidency.\nMy friend William Binney, probably the world\u2019s greatest expert on electronic surveillance, former Technical Director of the NSA, has stated that

enter public consciousness in the same way as the non-existent Russian hack of the DNC servers.\nAssange never met Manafort.\nThe DNC emails were downloaded by an insider.\nAssange never even considered fleeing to Russia.\nThose are the facts, and I am in a position to give you a personal assurance of them.\nI can also assure you that Luke Harding, the Guardian, Washington Post and New York Times have been publishing a stream of deliberate lies, in collusion with the security services.\nI am not a fan of Donald Trump.\nBut to see the partisans of the defeated candidate (and a particularly obnoxious defeated candidate) manipulate the security services and the media to create an entirely false public perception, in order to attempt to overturn the result of the US Presidential election, is the most astonishing thing I have witnessed in my lifetime.\nPlainly the government of Ecuador is releasing lies about Assange to curry favour with the security establishment of the USA and UK, and to damage Assange\u2019s support prior to expelling him from the Embassy.\nHe will then be extradited from London to the USA on charges of espionage.\nAssange is not a whistleblower or a spy \u2013 he is the greatest publisher of his age, and has done more to bring the crimes of governments to light than the mainstream media will ever be motivated to achieve.\nThat supposedly great newspaper titles like the Guardian, New York Times and Washington Post are involved in the spreading of lies to damage Assange, and are seeking his imprisonment for publishing state secrets, is clear evidence that the idea of the \u201cliberal media\u201d no longer exists in the new plutocratic age.\nThe press are not on the side of the people, they are an instrument of elite

Legislators will be on the ballot.\nSo, you have to whip up the Andrew Gillum voters again in those counties to vote out the Republican to get a Democratic Legislature in order for his (Gillum) will to be executed.\u201d\nSmith adds that because not all Democratic voters are the same, that the Gillum campaign needs to appeal to \u201cwhite guilt\u201d to turn out the vote:\nSMITH: \u201cYou have to appeal to white guilt\u2026 [be]cause that\u2019s what it is.\u201d\nSmith also explains that the Gillum campaign can\u2019t let voters know what Gillum\u2019s true agenda is before election

Broward, Santa Rosa, Citrus and Okaloosa counties and were reported to federal prosecutors to review for possible election fraud as Florida counties completed a required recount in three top

inaccurate Nov. 8 deadline.\nWe also know that a Broward County employee, Chelsey Smith, signed an affidavit affirming that she had seen members of Snipes' staff engaging in voter fraud.\nShe ignored a court order, mixed invalid provisional ballots in with valid ones, and destroyed ballots, but don't worry, a Democrat attorney says that doing so has nothing to do with fraud or corruption.\nNow

Guardian quickly \u2013 and very quietly \u2013 rowed back its initial certainty that its story was based on verified facts.\nInstead, it amended the text, without acknowledging it had done so, to attribute the claims to unnamed, and uncheckable, \u201csources\u201d.\nThe propaganda function of the piece is patent.\nIt is intended to provide evidence for long-standing allegations that Assange conspired with Trump, and Trump\u2019s supposed backers in the Kremlin, to damage Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential race.\nThe Guardian\u2019s latest story provides a supposedly stronger foundation for an existing narrative: that Assange and Wikileaks knowingly published emails hacked by Russia from the Democratic party\u2019s servers.\nIn truth, there is no public evidence that the emails were hacked, or that Russia was involved.\nCentral actors have suggested instead that the emails were leaked from within the Democratic party.\nNonetheless, this unverified allegation has been aggressively exploited by the Democratic leadership because it shifts attention away both from its failure to mount an effective electoral challenge to Trump and from the damaging contents of the emails.\nThese show that party bureaucrats sought to rig the primaries to make sure Clinton\u2019s challenger for the Democratic nomination, Bernie Sanders, lost.\nTo underscore the intended effect of the Guardian\u2019s new claims, Harding even throws in a casual and unsubstantiated reference to \u201cRussians\u201d joining Manafort in supposedly meeting Assange.\nManafort has denied the Guardian\u2019s claims, while Assange has threatened to sue the Guardian for libel.\n\u2018Responsible for Trump\u2019\nThe emotional impact of the Guardian story is to suggest that Assange is responsible for four years or more of Trump rule.\nBut more significantly, it bolsters the otherwise risible claim that Assange is not a publisher \u2013 and thereby entitled to the protections of a free press, as enjoyed by the Guardian or the New York Times \u2013 but the head of an organisation engaged in espionage for a foreign power.\nThe intention is to deeply discredit Assange, and by extension the Wikileaks organisation, in the eyes of right-thinking liberals.\nThat, in turn, will make it much easier to silence Assange and the vital cause he represents: the use of new media to hold to account the old, corporate media and political elites through the imposition of far greater transparency.\nThe Guardian story will prepare public opinion for the moment when Ecuador\u2019s rightwing government under President Lenin Moreno forces Assange out of the embassy, having already withdrawn most of his rights to use digital media.\nIt will soften opposition when the UK moves to arrest Assange on self-serving bail violation charges and extradites him to the US.\nAnd it will pave the way for the US legal system to lock Assange up for a very long time.\nFor the best part of a decade, any claims by Assange\u2019s supporters that avoiding this fate was the reason Assange originally sought asylum in the embassy was ridiculed by corporate journalists, not least at the Guardian.\nEven when a United Nations panel of experts in international law ruled in 2016 that Assange was being arbitrarily \u2013 and unlawfully \u2013 detained by the UK, Guardian writers led efforts to discredit the UN report.\nSee here and here.\nNow Assange and his supporters have been proved right once again.\nAn administrative error this month revealed that the US justice department had secretly filed criminal charges against Assange.\nHeavy surveillance\nThe problem for the Guardian, which should have been obvious to its editors from the outset, is that any visits by Manafort would be easily verifiable without relying on unnamed \u201csources\u201d.\nGlenn Greenwald is far from alone in noting that London is possibly the most surveilled city in the world, with CCTV cameras everywhere.\nThe environs of the Ecuadorian embassy are monitored especially heavily, with continuous filming by the UK and Ecuadorian authorities and most likely by the US and other actors with an interest in Assange\u2019s fate.\nThe idea that Manafort or \u201cRussians\u201d could have wandered into the embassy to meet Assange even once without their trail, entry and meeting being intimately scrutinised and recorded is simply preposterous.\nAccording to Greenwald: \u201cIf Paul Manafort \u2026 visited Assange at the Embassy, there would be ample amounts of video and other photographic proof demonstrating that this happened.\nThe Guardian provides none of that.\u201d\nFormer British ambassador Craig Murray also points out the extensive security checks insisted on by the embassy to which any visitor to Assange must submit.\nAny visits by Manafort would have been logged.\nIn fact, the Guardian obtained the embassy\u2019s logs in May, and has never made any mention of either Manafort or \u201cRussians\u201d being identified in them.\nIt did not refer to the logs in its latest story.\nMurray:\nThe problem with this latest fabrication is that [Ecuador\u2019s President] Moreno had already released the visitor logs to the Mueller inquiry.\nNeither Manafort nor these \u201cRussians\u201d are in the visitor logs \u2026 What possible motive would the Ecuadorean government have for facilitating secret unrecorded visits by Paul Manafort?\nFurthermore it is impossible that the intelligence agency \u2013 who were in charge of the security \u2013 would not know the identity of these alleged \u201cRussians\u201d.\nNo fact-checking\nIt is worth noting it should be vitally important for a serious publication like the Guardian to ensure its claims are unassailably true \u2013 both because Assange\u2019s personal fate rests on their veracity, and because, even more importantly, a fundamental right, the freedom of the press, is at stake.\nGiven this, one would have expected the Guardian\u2019s editors to have insisted on the most stringent checks imaginable before going to press with Harding\u2019s story.\nAt a very minimum, they should have sought out a response from Assange and Manafort before publication.\nNeither precaution was taken.\nI worked for the Guardian for a number of years, and know well the layers of checks that any highly sensitive story has to go through before publication.\nIn that lengthy process, a variety of commissioning editors, lawyers, backbench editors and the editor herself, Kath Viner, would normally insist on cuts to anything that could not be rigorously defended and corroborated.\nAnd yet this piece seems to have been casually waved through, given a green light even though its profound shortcomings were evident to a range of well-placed analysts and journalists from the outset.\nThat at the very least hints that the Guardian thought they had \u201cinsurance\u201d on this story.\nAnd the only people who could have promised that kind of insurance are the security and intelligence services \u2013 presumably of Britain, the United States and / or Ecuador.\nIt appears the Guardian has simply taken this story, provided by spooks, at face value.\nEven if it later turns out that Manafort did visit Assange, the Guardian clearly had no compelling evidence for its claims when it published them.\nThat is profoundly irresponsible journalism \u2013 fake news \u2013 that should be of the gravest concern to readers.\nA pattern, not an aberration\nDespite all this, even analysts critical of the Guardian\u2019s behaviour have shown a glaring failure to understand that its latest coverage represents not an aberration by the paper but decisively fits with a pattern.\nGlenn Greenwald, who once had an influential column in the Guardian until an apparent, though unacknowledged, falling out with his employer over the Edward Snowden revelations, wrote a series of baffling observations about the Guardian\u2019s latest story.\nFirst, he suggested it was simply evidence of the Guardian\u2019s long-standing (and well-documented) hostility towards Assange.\n\u201cThe Guardian, an otherwise solid and reliable paper, has such a pervasive and unprofessionally personal hatred for Julian Assange that it has frequently dispensed with all journalistic standards in order to malign him.\u201d\nIt was also apparently evidence of the paper\u2019s clickbait tendencies:\n\u201cThey [Guardian editors] knew that publishing this story would cause partisan warriors to excitedly spread the story, and that cable news outlets would hyperventilate over it, and that they\u2019d reap the rewards regardless of whether the story turned out to be true or false.\u201d\nAnd finally, in a bizarre tweet, Greenwald opined, \u201cI hope the story [maligning Assange] turns out true\u201d \u2013 apparently because maintenance of the Guardian\u2019s reputation is more important than Assange\u2019s fate and the right of journalists to dig up embarrassing secrets without fear of being imprisoned.\nI think the Guardian is an important paper with great journalists.\nI hope the story turns out true.\nBut the skepticism over this story is very widespread, including among Assange's most devoted haters, because it's so sketchy.\nIf Manafort went there, there's video.\nLet's see it.\n\u2014 Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) November 28, 2018\nDeeper malaise\nWhat this misses is that the Guardian\u2019s attacks on Assange are not exceptional or motivated solely by personal animosity.\nThey are entirely predictable and systematic.\nRather than being the reason for the Guardian violating basic journalistic standards and ethics, the paper\u2019s hatred of Assange is a symptom of a deeper malaise in the Guardian and the wider corporate media.\nEven aside from its decade-long campaign against Assange, the Guardian is far from \u201csolid and reliable\u201d, as Greenwald claims.\nIt has been at the forefront of the relentless, and unhinged, attacks on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for prioritising the rights of Palestinians over Israel\u2019s right to continue its belligerent occupation.\nOver the past three years, the Guardian has injected credibility into the Israel lobby\u2019s desperate efforts to tar Corbyn as an anti-semite.\nSee here, here and here.\nSimilarly, the Guardian worked tirelessly to promote Clinton and undermine Sanders in the 2016 Democratic nomination process \u2013 another reason the paper has been so assiduous in promoting the idea that Assange, aided by Russia, was determined to promote Trump over Clinton for the presidency.\nThe Guardian\u2019s coverage of Latin America, especially of populist leftwing governments that have rebelled against traditional and oppressive US hegemony in the region, has long grated with analysts and experts.\nIts especial venom has been reserved for leftwing figures like Venezuela\u2019s Hugo Chavez, democratically elected but official enemies of the US, rather than the region\u2019s rightwing authoritarians beloved of Washington.\nThe Guardian has been vocal in the so-called \u201cfake news\u201d hysteria, decrying the influence of social media, the only place where leftwing dissidents have managed to find a small foothold to promote their politics and counter the corporate media narrative.\nThe Guardian has painted social media chiefly as a platform overrun by Russian trolls, arguing that this should justify ever-tighter restrictions that have so far curbed critical voices of the dissident left more than the right.\nHeroes of the neoliberal order\nEqually, the Guardian has made clear who its true heroes are.\nCertainly not Corbyn or Assange, who threaten to disrupt the entrenched neoliberal order that is hurtling us towards climate breakdown and economic collapse.\nIts pages, however, are readily available to the latest effort to prop up the status quo from Tony Blair, the man who led Britain, on false pretences, into the largest crime against humanity in living memory \u2013 the attack on Iraq.\nThat \u201chumanitarian intervention\u201d cost the lives of many hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and created a vacuum that destabilised much of the Middle East, sucked in Islamic jihadists like al-Qaeda and ISIS, and contributed to the migrant crisis in Europe that has fuelled the resurgence of the far-right.\nNone of that is discussed in the Guardian or considered grounds for disqualifying Blair as an arbiter of what is good for Britain and the world\u2019s future.\nThe Guardian also has an especial soft spot for blogger Elliot Higgins, who, aided by the Guardian, has shot to unlikely prominence as a self-styled \u201cweapons expert\u201d.\nLike Luke Harding, Higgins invariably seems ready to echo whatever the British and American security services need verifying \u201cindependently\u201d.\nHiggins and his well-staffed website Bellingcat have taken on for themselves the role of arbiters of truth on many foreign affairs issues, taking a prominent role in advocating for narratives that promote US and NATO hegemony while demonising Russia, especially in highly contested arenas such as Syria.\nThat clear partisanship should be no surprise, given that Higgins now enjoys an \u201cacademic\u201d position at, and funding from, the Atlantic Council, a high-level, Washington-based think-tank founded to drum up support for NATO and justify its imperialist agenda.\nImprobably, the Guardian has adopted Higgins as the poster-boy for a supposed citizen journalism it has sought to undermine as \u201cfake news\u201d whenever it occurs on social media without the endorsement of state-backed organisations.\nThe truth is that the Guardian has not erred in this latest story attacking Assange, or in its much longer-running campaign to vilify him.\nWith this story, it has done what it regularly does when supposedly vital western foreign policy interests are at stake \u2013 it simply regurgitates an elite-serving, western narrative.\nIts job is to shore up a consensus on the left for attacks on leading threats to the existing, neoliberal order: whether they are a platform like Wikileaks promoting whistle-blowing against a corrupt western elite; or a politician like Jeremy Corbyn seeking to break apart the status quo on the rapacious financial industries or Israel-Palestine; or a radical leader like Hugo Chavez who threatened to overturn a damaging and exploitative US dominance of \u201cAmerica\u2019s backyard\u201d; or social media dissidents who have started to chip away at the elite-friendly narratives of corporate media, including the Guardian.\nThe Guardian did not make a mistake in vilifying Assange without a shred of evidence.\nIt did what it is designed to do.\nUPDATE: Excellent background from investigative journalist Gareth Porter, published shortly before Harding\u2019s story, explains why the Guardian\u2019s hit-piece is so important for those who want Assange out of the embassy and behind bars.\nRead Porter\u2019s article here.\nNo one pays me to

Trusted\nNovember 29, 2018\nThis Guardian Fake News Story Proves That The Media Can't Be Trusted\nIn 2015 the British Guardian appointed Katherine Viner as editor in chief.\nUnder her lead the paper took a new direction.\nWhile it earlier made attempts to balance its shoddier side with some interesting reporting, it is now solidly main stream in the worst sense.\nIt promotes neo-liberalism and a delves into cranky identity grievances stories.\nIt also became an main outlet for manipulative propaganda peddled by the British secret services.\nIts recent fake news story about Paul Manafort, Wikileaks and Julian Assange aptly demonstrates this.\nThe documentation of it is a bit lengthy but provides that it was a willful fake.\nOn November 27 the Guardian prepared to publish a story which asserted that Paula Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, had met Julian Assange, the publisher of Wikileaks, in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on at least three occasions.\nSome two hours before the story went public it contacted Manafort and Assange's lawyers to get their comments.\nAssange's Wikileaks responded through its public Twitter account which has 5.4 million followers.\nOn of those followers is Katherine Viner:\nWikiLeaks @wikileaks - 13:06 utc - 27 Nov 2018 SCOOP: In letter today to Assange's lawyers, Guardian's Luke Harding, winner of Private Eye's Plagiarist of the Year, falsely claims jailed former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort had secret meetings with Assange in 2013, 2015 and 2016 in story Guardian are \"planning to run\".\nIt attached the email the Guardian's Luke Harding had send.\n90 minutes later the Guardian piece went life.\nIt led the front page and also appeared in print.\nThe first version read:\nManafort held secret talks with Assange in Ecuadorian embassy Donald Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Paul Manafort held secret talks with Julian Assange inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London, and visited around the time he joined Trump\u2019s campaign, the Guardian has been told.\nSources have said Manafort went to see Assange in 2013, 2015 and in spring 2016 \u2013 during the period when he was made a key figure in Trump\u2019s push for the White House.\nIt is unclear why Manafort wanted to see Assange and what was discussed.\nBut the last meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\nA well-placed source has told the Guardian that Manafort went to see Assange around March 2016.\nMonths later WikiLeaks released a stash of Democratic emails stolen by Russian intelligence officers.\nManafort, 69, denies involvement in the hack and says the claim is \u201c100% false\u201d.\nHis lawyers declined to answer the Guardian\u2019s questions about the visits.\nThe piece did not include the public denial Wikileaks issued to its 5.4 million followers one and a half hour before it was published.\nThe Guardian piece came at a critical moment.\nCurrently the U.K. and Ecuador conspire to deliver Julian Assange to U.S. authorities.\nOn Monday special counsel Robert Mueller said Manafort lied to investigators, violating his recent plea deal.\nThe new sensational claim was immediately picked up by prominent reporters and major main stream outlets.\nThey distributed is as a factual account.\nIt is likely that millions of people took note of its claim.\nBut several people who had followed the Russiagate fairytale and the Mueller investigation were immediately suspicious of the Guardian claim.\nThe story was weakly sourced and included some details that seemed unlikely to be true.\nGlenn Greenwald noted that the Ecuadorian embassy is under heavy CCTV surveillance.\nThere are several guards, and visitors have to provide their identity to enter it.\nEvery visit is logged.\nIf Manafort had really visited Assange, it would have long been known:\nIn sum, the Guardian published a story today that it knew would explode into all sorts of viral benefits for the paper and its reporters even though there are gaping holes and highly sketchy aspects to the story.\nMoreover, the main author of the story, Luke Harding, is known to be a notorious fraud, a russo-phobe intelligence asset with a personal grievance towards Assange and Wikileaks.\nA year ago an important Moon of Alabama piece - From Snowden To Russia-gate - The CIA And The Media - mentioned Harding:\nThe people who promote the \"Russian influence\" nonsense are political operatives or hacks.\nTake for example Luke Harding of the Guardian who just published a book titled Collusion: Secret Meetings, Dirty Money, and How Russia Helped Donald Trump Win.\nHe was taken apart in a Real News interview (vid) about the book.\nThe interviewer pointed out that there is absolutely no evidence in the book to support its claims.\nWhen asked for any proof for his assertion Harding defensively says that he is just \"storytelling\" - in other words: it is fiction.\nHarding earlier wrote a book about Edward Snowden which was a similar sham.\nJulian Assange called it \"a hack job in the purest sense of the term\".\nHarding is also known as plagiarizer.\nWhen he worked in Moscow he copied stories and passages from the now defunct Exile, run by Matt Taibbi and Mark Ames.\nThe Guardian had to publish an apology.\nThe new Guardian story looked like another weak attempt to connect the alleged Russian malfeasance with Assange and the Wikileaks publishing of the DNC emails.\nAssange and other involved people deny that such a relation existed.\nThere is no public evidence that support such claims.\nShortly after the Guardian's fake news story went public Paul Manafort issued an unequivocal denial:\n\u201cI have never met Julian Assange or anyone connected to him,\u201d the statement said.\n\u201cI have never been contacted by anyone connected to Wikileaks, either directly or indirectly.\nI have never reached out to Assange or Wikileaks on any matter.\nWe are considering all legal options against the Guardian who proceeded with this story even after being notified by my representatives that it was false.\u201d\nAt 16:05 utc the Guardian silently edited the story.\nCaveats (here in italic and underlined) were added to the headline and within several paragraphs.\nNo editorial note was attached to inform the readers of the changes:\nManafort held secret talks with Assange in Ecuadorian embassy, sources say ...\nIt is unclear why Manafort would have wanted to see Assange and what was discussed.\nBut the last apparent meeting is likely to come under scrutiny and could interest Robert Mueller, the special prosecutor who is investigating alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n...\nWhy Manafort might have sought out Assange in 2013 is unclear.\n...\nManafort, 69, denies involvement in the hack and says the claim is \u201c100% false\u201d.\nHis lawyers initially declined to answer the Guardian\u2019s questions about the visits.\nOne paragraph was added to included Wikileaks' denial:\nIn a series of tweets WikiLeaks said Assange and Manafort had not met.\nAssange described the story as a hoax.\nAt 16:30 utc, under fire from other media and journalists, the Guardian issued a statement:\nThis story relied on a number of sources.\nWe put these allegations to both Paul Manafort and Julian Assange's representatives prior to publication.\nNeither responded to deny the visits taking place.\nWe have since updated the story to reflect their denials.\nThis defensive Guardian claim is, like its story, evidently completely false.\nWikileaks publicly denied the Guardian's claims 90 minutes before the story was first published.\nManafort asserts that his lawyers had notified the Guardian that the story was false before the Guardian 'proceeded with the story'.\nAt 21:05 utc a third version was published which included Manafort's denial.\nHalf an hour later Julian Assange instructed his lawyers to sue the Guardian for libel.\nWikileaks opened a fund to support the lawsuit.\nA day after the Guardian smear piece the Washington Times reported that Manafort's passports, entered into evidence by the Mueller prosecution, show that he did not visit London in any of the years the Guardian claimed he was there to visit Assange.\nThe story was completely false and the Guardian knew it was.\nIt disregarded and left out the denials the subjects of the story had issued before it was published.\nThe Guardian has become a main outlet for British government disinformation operations aimed at defaming Russia.\nIt smeared Assange and Snowden as Russian collaborators.\nIt uncritically peddled the Russiagate story and the nonsensical Skripal claims which are both obviously concocted by British intelligence services.\nThat seems to have become its main purpose.\nAs Disobediant Media notes (emphasis in the original):\nWhile most readers with functional critical thinking capacity may readily dismiss the Guardian\u2019s smear on its face, the fact that the Guardian published this piece, and that Luke Harding is still operating with even the tiniest modicum of respect as a journalist despite his history of deceit, tells us something bone-chilling about journalism.\nIt is no accident that Luke Harding is still employed: in fact, it is because of Harding\u2019s consistent loyalty to establishment, specifically the UK intelligence apparatus, over the truth that determines his \u201csuccess\u201d amongst legacy press outlets.\nHarding is not a defacement or a departure from the norm, but the personification of it.\nJonathan Cook, a former Guardian writer, makes a similar point:\nThe truth is that the Guardian has not erred in this latest story attacking Assange, or in its much longer-running campaign to vilify him.\nWith this story, it has done what it regularly does when supposedly vital western foreign policy interests are at stake \u2013 it simply regurgitates an elite-serving, western narrative.\nIts job is to shore up a consensus on the left for attacks on leading threats to the existing, neoliberal order: ...\nThe Guardian did not make a mistake in vilifying Assange without a shred of evidence.\nIt did what it is designed to do.\nWe have previously shown that the Guardian even uses fascist propaganda tropes to smear the Russian people.\nIt is openly publishing Goebbels' cartoons and rhetoric against Europes biggest state.\nThere is no longer any line that it does not dare to cross.\nUnfortunately other 'western' media are not much better.\nWithin hours of being published the Guardian piece was debunked as fake news.\nThat did not hinder other outlets to add to its smear.\nPolitico allowed \"a former CIA officer,\" writing under a pen name, to suggest - without any evidence - that the Guardian has been duped - not by its MI5/6 and Ecuadorian spy sources, but by Russian disinformation:\nRather than being the bombshell smoking gun that directly connects the Trump campaign to WikiLeaks, perhaps the report is something else entirely: a disinformation campaign.\nIs it possible someone planted this story as a means to discredit the journalists?\n...\nHarding is likely a major target for anyone wrapped up in Russia\u2019s intelligence operation against the West\u2019s democratic institutions.\n...\nIf this latest story about Manafort and Assange is false\u2014that is, if, for example, the sources lied to Harding and Collyns (or if the sources themselves were lied to and thus thought they were being truthful in their statements to the journalists), or if the Ecuadorian intelligence document is a fake, the most logical explanation is that it is an attempt to make Harding look bad.\nThe is zero evidence in the Politico screed that supports its suggestions and claims.\nIt is fake news about a fake news story.\nIt also included the false claim that Glenn Greenwald worked with Wikileaks on the Snowden papers.\nThat claim was later removed.\nWe have seen a similar pattern in the Skripal affair.\nWhen 'western' intelligence get caught in spreading disinformation, they accuse Russia of being the source of the fake.\nUnfortunately no western main stream media can any longer be trusted to publish the truth.\nThe Guardian is only one of many which peddle smears and disinformation about the 'enemies' of the ruling 'western interests'.\nIt is on all of us to debunk them and to educate the public about their scheme.\n---\nThis is a Moon of Alabama fundraiser week.\nNo one pays me to write these blog posts.\nIf you appreciated this one, or any of the 7,000+ others, please consider a
